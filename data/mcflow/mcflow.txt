Tilt your head back; let's finish the cup.
M C A with the bottle D rocks the can.
AdRock gets nice with Charlie Chan.
We're offered Moet we don't mind Chivas
Whereever we go we bring the Monkey with us.
AdRock drinks three; Mike D is D;
Double R foots the bill most definitely
I drink brass monkey and I rock well.
I got a castle in Brooklyn that's where I dwell.
Cause I drink it anytime and anyplace
When it's time to get ill I pour it on my face;
Monkey tastes Def when you pour it on ice.
Come on y'all it's time to get nice.
Coolin' by the lockers gettin' kind of funky
Me and the crew we're drinking brass monkey
This girl walked by she gave me the eye;
I reached in the locker grabbed the Spanish fly;
I put it with the Monkey mixed it in a cup.
Went over to the girl Yo baby what's up?;
I offered her a sip girl she gave me lip;
Did begin the stuff wore in and now she's on my tip.
Step up to the bar, put the girl down;
She takes a big gulp and slaps it around Take a sip;
You can do it; You get right to it.
We had a case in the place and we went right through it.
You got a dry Martini you're thinkin' you're cool;
Take your place at the bar I smack you off your stool.
I'll down a forty dog in a single gulp.
And if you got beef you'll get beat to a pulp.
Monkey and parties and reelin' and rockin'
Def def girls girls all y'all jockin'
The song and dance keeping you in a trance.
If you don't buy my record I got my advance
I drink it; I think it; I see it; I be it.
I love Brass Monkey but I won't give D it.
We got the bottle you got the cup;
Come on everybody let's get f.
who's that gigolo on the street .
with his hands in his pockets and his crocodile feet .
hangin' off the curb looking all disturbed .
at the boys from home . they all came runnin'
they were makin' noise . manhandling toys .
that's the girls on the block . with the nasty curls .
wearin' padded bras sucking beers through straws
droppin' down their drawers where did you get yours .
so you say you wanted money but you know it's never funny
when your shoes worn through and there's a rumble in your tummy
but you had to have style get a gold tooth smile
put a girl on the corner so you can make a pile .
committed a crime and went inside .
it was comin' your way . but you had to survive
when you lost your babe . you lost the race
now you're lookin' at me to take her place .
This here's a tale for all the fellas
Tryin' to do what those ladies tell us.
Get shot down cause ya over zealous
Play hard to get females get jealous
okay smarty go to a party
Girls are scantily clad and showin' body
A chick walks by you wish you could sex her;
But you're standin' on the wall like you was Poindexter
Next days function high class luncheon
Food they're serving you're stone cold munchin'
Music comes on people start to dance;
But then you ate so mutch you nearly split your pants.
A girl starts walkin' guys start gawking
Sits down next to you and starts talking
Says she wants to dance cause she likes to groove;
So come on fatso and just bust a move.
You're on a mission and your wishin'
Someone could cure your lonely condition
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
No fine girls just ugly faces
From frustration first inclination
is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a light of hope;
So don't hang yourself with a celibate rope
Your movie's showin' so you're goin'
Could care less about the five you're blowin'
Theater gets dark just to start the show;
Then ya spot a fine woman sittin' in your row;
She's dressed in yellow she says Hello
come sit next to me you fine fellow
You run over there without a second to lose;
And what comes next hey bust a move.
In this city ladies look pretty
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty
Tell a funny joke just to get some play;
Then you try to make a move and she says No way.
Girls are fakin' goodness sakin'
They want the man who brings home the bacon
Got no money and you got no car;
Then you got no women and there you are.
Some girls are sadistic materialistic
Lookin' for a man makes them opportunistic
They're lyin' on a beach perpetrating a tan
So that a brother with the money can be their man.
So on the beach you're strollin' real high rollin'
Everything you have is yours and not stolen
A girl runs up with somethin' to prove;
So don't just stand there bust a move.
Your best friend Harry has a brother Larry
In five days from now he's gonna marry
He's hopin' you can make it there if you can;
'Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man.
You say neat O; check your libido
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo
The bride walks down just to start the wedding
And there's one more girl you won't be getting
So start fakin' then you start blinkin'
The bridesmaid looks and thinks that you're winking
She thinks your kinda cute so she winks back;
And now your feelin' really firm cause the girl is stacked
Receptions jumpin' bass is pumpin'
You look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin'
Says she wants to dance to a different
Now you know what to do just bust a move.
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild wild west.
A state that's untouchable like Elliot Ness.
The track hits ya eardrum like a slug to ya chest.
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex.
We in that sunshine state where the bomb ass hemp be.
The state where ya never find a dance floor empty.
And pimps be on a mission for them greens.
:Lean mean money makin' machines servin' fiends.
I been in the game for ten years makin' rap tunes.
Ever since honeys was wearin' sassoon.
Now it's ninety five and they clock me and watch me.
Diamonds shinin'; Lookin' like I robbed Liberace.
It's all good from Diego to the Bay.
Your city is the bomb, if your city makin' pay.
Throw up a finger if ya feel the same way.
Dre puttin' it down for Californ I A.
Out on bail Fresh out of jail California dreamin'.
Soon as I step on the scene I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'.
Fiendin' for money and alcohol; The life of a Westside player.
Where cowards die and the strong ball.
Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die.
In LA we wearin' Chucks not Ballies.
Yeah that's right.
Dressed in Locs and khaki suits, and ride is what we do.
Flossin' but have caution.
We collide with other crews.
Famous because we throw grands worldwide.
Let 'em recognize from Long Beach to Rosecranz.
Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam.
It's Westside— so you know the Row won't bow down to no man.
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre.
Let me serenade the streets of LA.
From Oakland to Sac town the Bay area and back down.
Cali is where they put they mack down.
Give me love.
Can I hit it in the mornin' without givin' you half of my dough
And even worse if I was broke would you want me?
If I couldn't get you finer things Like all of them diamond rings
bitches kill for Would you still roll?
If we couldn't see the sun risin' off the shore of Thailand
would you ride then? If I wasn't drivin'
If I wasn't a eight figure nigga by the name of Jigga
would you come around me Or would you clown me?
If I couldn't flow futuristic would ya
put your two lips on my wood and kiss it? Could ya
see yourself with a nigga workin' harder than nien to five
con ten to six two jobs to survive or

King of my jungle just a gangster stalkin'.
Livin' life like a firecracker ;Quick is my fuse.
Then dead as a death pack the colors I choose.
Red or Blue Cuz or Blood it just don't matter.
Sucker die for your life when my shotgun scatters.
We gangs of L A will never die. Just multiply.
You don't know me fool; You disown me cool.
I don't need your assistance Social persistence
Any problem I got I just put my fist in.
My life is violent but violent is life;
Peace is a dream; reality is a knife.
My colors my honour my colors my all;
With my colors upon me one soldier stands tall.
Tell me what have you left me; what have I got?.
Last night in cold blood my young brother got shot;
My home boy got jacked;
My mother's on crack;
My sister can't work cause her arms show tracks.
Madness insanity live in profanity
Then some punk claimin' they understandin' me;
Give me a break what world do you live in?.
My pants are saggin' braided hair;
suckers stare but I don't care.
My game ain't knowledge my game's fear.
I've no remorse so squares beware
But my true mission is just revenge
You ain't in my sect you ain't my friend;
Wear the wrong color your life could end.
homicide's my favorite binge.
So I'll just walk like a giant police defiant
You'll say to stop but I'll say that I can't;
my gangs my family its all that I have.
I'm a star; on the walls my autograph
You don't like it so you know where you can go.
'cause the streets are my stage and terror's my show.
psycho analyze tried diagnosin' me why?.
It wasn't your brother that brutally died;
But it was mine. so let me define
my territory don't cross the line.
Don't try to act crazy
cause that shit don't phase me.
If you ran like a punk
it wouldn't amaze me.
cause my colors death
thou we all want peace;
but our war won't end
they'll always see.
The club was far from empty .
It was crowded at the entry .
I slide right through like how I do
this girl began to tempt me .
She said her name Shaiyeeda .
I could tell her mama feed her .
when they tight and when them jeans don't fit
I'm L nice to meet ya .
I could feel my body yearnin' .
the room just started turnin' .
didn't wanna go out on the floor
but this girl was so determined .
my brain began to sizzle .
I'm sweatin' just a little .
on the dance floor in the middle .
she turned around and giggled .
she said .
temptation is a mother .
how we lust . for one another .
we barely know each other .
yet we're whilin' like we're lovers .
the air is filled with passion .
the strobe lights are flashin' .
the hustlers throw cash in .
the bar tender keeps splashin' .

I'm battling desire .

hotter than a shot of cuervo .
her top was short and purple .
belly dancin' in a circle .

run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on

Hands up on the dance floor okay let's go
emcees try'na play post . play me up close . brag and boast ya know .
things like that make me weary but .
I never let a rapper get near me cuz
I'm Rob Base . pick up the pace .
it takes more than beats to rock this place .
it takes more than rhymes to rock this time .
rhyme for rhyme the Base design
M Cs get mad . cuz I'm blowin' up .
to every battle . the base keeps showin' up .
a fast tempo . a with a hook .
don't judge a book by the way that the cover look .
cuz I'm mean . reign supreme .
wrote my first rhyme at the age of fifteen .
I'm like a match when struck I burn .
not concerned cuz I'm sure that ya won't learn .
now git up . and let's start .
I wanna see which sucka got heart .
I get fresh . as I get older .
every time I rock I get bolder
so don't sleep . and say I'm wack .
cuz if ya do ya get backslap backslap .
drop your ego . and let me go
and just show what I know cuz I'm on the go
I rock smooth bust a move hit me .
and the way I perform you can't forget me
Clear off the smoke . this ain't a joke .
the new kid on the block is like dope
been here for a while . been all punishment .
but now I'm on . so let's start it .
no I'm not retarded . or either crazy .
I work hard . I'm not lazy
rappers don't faze me . or eve amaze me .
or either come up close and just graze me
coolin' . neva be a fool and
gimme just a little mo' time I be rulin' .
tell it to the mack . cuz I'm on wax .
but should I pay tac . or should I just act .
to get a new job . yes . time is what I'm pressed for .
every time perform ya want more so .
ah break it down . to get the dope sound
then hang around with the posse from uptown .
on the ave . they get cash .
but I leave it alone cuz I'm a smash .
on the mic . I think differently . a from another or other MC who .
intervene try to just rip . up the rob on the sneak tip .
I get mad . they get sad . or either rag the had cuz I'm that bad .
I'm not frontin' . cuz this is my theory .
you don't believe me . so just hear me .
I rock harder . I rock longer .
I do this cuz I gotta get stronger .
a lotta rappers rhyme harder and meaner .
.but I rhyme with the sound that's cleaner .
I ain't nuthin' . that's what they say .
well OK if they wanna play that way .
cuz I'm Rob butt kickin' Base .
what rapper is next to be erased .
.on my list I'm not known to diss
but I'll do it . so don't sleep on this c'mon
hit it admit it ya did it ya can't fit it .
so forget it cuz I know you ain't wit' it .
in the centre . I didn't rent her .
sat cha butt in the chair got a splinta
back in the days . amazed by the rap craze
rap today . to me it don't faze me .
I'm not another M C . or angry by the way ya speak to me .
jealousy what makes you wanna battle me .
dope beats what makes you wanna idol me .
it ain't nuthin' to me or E Z
cuz I'm the R the O the B . and he's E Z .
I bust a fee whereever it be ya see .
he or me the E the Z the A the B
alphabet's from a to Z ya see .
I'm not try'na confuse your mind .
I'm just tryin' to pump this plain old fresh rhyme .
I stay calm rap like a pro .
I know ya know so let's go c'mon .
It's been three weeks since you were lookin' for your Friend
the one you let hit it and never called you again .
member when he told you he was bout the benjamins
you act like you ain't here him but gave him a little trim
to begin . how you think you're really going pretend .
like you wasn't down and you called him again
plus when . you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him .
if you did it then then you'd probably do again .
talkin' out your neck sayin' you're a christian .
a muslim sleepin' with the gin
now that was the sin that did jezebel in
who you goin' tell when the repercussions spin .
showin' off your ass 'cause you're thinkin' it's a trend
girlfriend . let me break it down for you again .
you know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
baby girl . respect is just the minimum .
nigga's creepin' and you still defendin' him
now Lauryn is only human .
don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly been .
it's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in .
look at what you be in hair weaves like Europeans
fake nails up out Koreans .
come again .
The second verse is dedicated to the men .
more concerned with his rims and his Tims than his women
him and his men . come in the club like hooligans
don't care who they offend poppin' game like you got yen
let's stop pretend . the ones that pack pistol by they waist men
cristal by the case men Still livin' mother's basement
The pretty face men Claimin' that they did a bid men .
Need to take care of their three and four kids
but they facing court case when the child support's . late
Money takin' heart breakin' now you wonder why women hate men
the sleepy silent men .
the punk domestic violence men
And quick to shoot the scene to stop actin' like boys and be men
How you gonna win when you ain't right within .
How you gonna win when you ain't right within .
How you gonna win when you ain't right within .
Uhuh .
Come again .
down with the king for years about ten of 'em .
recruiting suckers Mac and Mike and makin' men of 'em .
tears and fears for my peers . they rippin' .
you think that it is it is if not it isn't .
race for the border my daughter 'cause beats you're bangin' out .
jeeps rockin' beats in the streets when there's time for hangin' out .
gather . or rather form a circle around a loud
'cause the brothers or others could never ever rock a crowd .
is it . because he's runnin' off with the mouth .
or was he really clearly tryin' play a nigga out .
nope shut him down . the king with a crown .
'cause all you wanna be is dicky down .
two years ago a friend of mine .
asked me to say some M C rhymes
so I said this rhyme I'm about to say .

wrecka lecka Mecca mic check on the windmill skills
mac distracts wearing Godfather hats .
it's okay to parlay to forte better .
tell 'em my nigga made a sweater tougher than leather .
swing another Rodney king thing in our right
we're just like the white one I get no respect .
money stay awake 'cause them other niggas are fake
from Hollis to the beacon now your dumb ass is leakin' .
C L and run D M C so rush it .
big time way before hammer got to touch it .
remember the faces . in all types of places
look ma no shoelaces .
and I'm .
I'm takin' the tours . I'm wreckin' the land .
I keep it hardcore 'cause it's dope man .
these are the roughest toughest words I ever wrote down .
not meant for a hoe like a slow jam . check it .
sucka emcees could never swing with D .
because of all the things that I bring with me .
only G O D could be a king to me .
and if the G O D be in me then the king I be .
the microphone is granted when it's handed to me .
I was planted on this planet and I plan to emcee .
the emcee fiends only seem to agree .
that I rock all the world and the society .
I rages on the stages with a tune of verse .
I get praises from these pages to the universe .
my voice is raw . my lyrics is law .
I keep it hardcore like you never saw you wanna be .
I'm the man you see in the place to be
I went to John Jay University .
and since kindergarten I acquired the knowledge .
and after twelfth grade I went straight to college .

Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from.
Catch me at the X with O G at a Yankee game;
Shit I made the Yankee hat more famous then a Yankee can.
You should know I bleed blue but I ain't a Crip though;
but I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though.
Welcome to the meltin' pot; corners where we sellin' rock;
Afrika Bambataa shit home of the hip hop.
Yellow cab gypsy cab dollar cab holla back;
for foreigners it ain't fair they act like they forgot how to act.
eight million stories out there in the naked city
is a pity half of y'all won't make it.
Me I gotta plug Special Ed I Got it Made.

Three dice cee lo three card molly
Labor Day Parade rest in peace Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty long live the World Trade.

Lights is blindin' girls need blinders
so they can step out of bounds quick; the sidelines is
lined with casualties who sip the life casually
then gradually become worse; don't bite the apple Eve.
Caught up in the in crowd now you're in style;
Anna Wintour gets cold in Vogue wi'tcha skin out.
City of sin. It's a pity on the whim.
Good girls gone bad the city's filled with them;
Mami took a bus trip now she got her bust out;
Everybody ride her just like a bus route.
Hail Mary to the city you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you;
life starts when the church end.
Came here for school graduated to the high life;
Ball players rap stars addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps better slip you an Ambien
now the party didn't start till I walked in
and I probably wont leave until the thing ends .
but in the mean time the in between time .
if you work your thing then i'll work mine .
we came here together so we could have fun .
me and you baby goin' one on one
now this is the last chance for us to get off .
so either get loose or you ought to get lost
'cause I'm just about ready to do my thing
'cause I'm the stone cold new york . rap machine .
I'mma give you what I got and baby that's plenty .
you'll never have one that rocks so many
I'mma make you wet . and make you sweat .
just to see how funky you can get .
now when I'm on the mic I do serve well
and I go by the name of the rapper Jalil .
now sit back relax put on your head gear .
get ready for a trip through the atmosphere .
gonna take you for a ride through the twilight zone
I don't need a space ship I use my microphone .
so hold on tight . with all your might
'cause i'll be rappin' like this for the rest of the night .
it's Jalil y'all your master rapper .
and when I'm on the mic it's a sheer disaster
'cause MCs crumble when we rumble .
some think im soft just because im humble .
so all you MC's I hope you're real good listeners
'cause in this battle I'm takin' no prisoners
I'm slayin' MCs right on the spot
'cause I'm the master of the rap the doctor of the rock .
the jack of all trades the master of one
and the thing I'm at is called havin' fun .
we got three minutes left . to rock this funk .
to separate the good stuff from the junk so .
get in the groove . and feel the sound .
and once you're inside spread yourself around .
from the bottom to the top the top . to the bottom .
come on master dee and get funky while we got 'em .
me and my partner from the start .
we usually together . after dark .
sometimes to rap . sometimes to sing .
in the summer or the winter cause it ain't no thing .
and ever since I first came round .
side by side . we'd throw down .
we came here to this here place .
to serve you all right to your face
because this jam here is our show stopper .
we didn't wanna do it but I guess we gotta
we're the men of the hour makin' the ladies scream and holler .
to hot to trot to sweet to be sour .
I'm gonna set the record straight
and I hope that it is not too late .
if you want the best I wont settle for less .
put your money on me I'm your best bet
come on
one for the treble .
two for the bass .
three for the ladies .
four for the played .
five minutes of funk . this ain't no junk .
so pull your bottom off the tree stump .
ladies real pretty . city to city .
but now we're gettin' down to the nitty gritty
from the bottom to the top . top . to the bottom .
im gonna rock 'em while I still got 'em
our rappin' shower has style and power
and this . is our disco hour
I don't know if . all of you have heard .
so it's up to me to spread the word
about the man that we feel has got to be real .
our crowned prince on the wheels of steel .
he goes by the name of grandmaster dee .
so if it's alright with you it's alright with me .
we gonna rock you people's minds with ease .
with some help from the meastro if you please
friends is a word we use everyday .
most the time we use it . in the wrong way .
now you can look the word up again and again .
but the dictionary doesn't know the meaning of friends
and if you ask me you know I couldn't be much help .
because a friend's somebody you judge for yourself .
some are OK . and they treat you real cool .
but some mistake your kindness for bein' a fool
we like to be with some . because they're funny .
others come around when they need some money .
some you grew up with . around the way .
and you're still real close too this very day .
homeboys through the summer winter spring and fall .
and then there's some we wish we never knew at all
and this list goes on . again and again .
but these are the people that we call friends .
when we first went out together we barely knew each other .
we had no intentions . on becoming lovers
but in no time at all you became my girl .
me and you one on one . against the world .
talkin' on the telephone for hours at a time
or else I was at your house or you was at mine .
and then came the arguments and all kinds of problems .
besides makin' love we had nothing in common .
it could've lasted long because it started out strong
but I guess we went about the whole thing wrong .
'cause out of nowhere it just came to an end
because we became lovers before we were friends .
you say you and your girlfriend were so tight .
you took her out with you and your guy one night .
she even had a set of keys to your home
and you shared mostly everything you owned
but as she shook your hand she stole your man
and it was done so swift it had to be a plan
couldn't trust her with cheese let alone your keys .
with friends like that you don't need enemies .
you wonder how long it was all going on
and your still not sure if your man is gone
you say well if she took him he was never mine .
but deep inside you know thats just another lie .
and now you're kinda cold tward the people you meet .
'cause of somethin' that was done to you by some creep .
but never the less . i'll say it again .
that these are the people that we call friends .
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death .
I take a look at my life . and realize there's nuttin' left .
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
that . Even my mama thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it .
Me be treated like a punk you know that's unheard of .
You better watch how you talkin' . and where you walkin' .
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk .
I really hate to trip but I gotta loc .
As they croak I see myself in the pistol smoke .
fool . I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night sayin' prayers in the street light .
Look at the situation they got me facin' .
I can't live a normal life . I was raised by the strict .
So I gotta be down with the hood team .
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams .
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind .
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye .
I'm a loced out gangsta set . trippin' banger .
And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger .
fool . Death ain't nothin' but a heartbeat away
I'm livin' life . do or die a . what can I say? .
I'm twenty three now but will I live to see twenty four?
The way . things is goin' I don't know .
Power and the money . Money and the power .
Minute after minute . hour after hour .
Everybody's runnin' . but half of them ain't lookin'
It's goin' on in the kitchen . but I don't know what's cookin' .
They say I gotta learn but nobody's here to teach me .
If they can't understand it . how can they reach me? .
I guess they can't . I guess they won't .
I guess they front . that's why I know my life is outta luck fool

what I'm involved with is deep and it amazes baby baby and it ain't no secret .
my family from Cuba but I'm an American idol gettin' money like Seacrest
I was walking down the street rocking my beat
clapping my hands and stomping my feet.
I saw a little lady so neat and petite.
She was so sweet; Yes I wanted to meet.
And so I asked this lady could I take her out.
:We could wine and dine and talk about
the birds and the bees in my waterbed.
,And you could treat me like a Buddha and bow your head.
We continued to talk ,and before you knew it
we were at my house ,and it was time to do it.
As soon as I finished I lost my poise
,Ran outside and told all my boys.
:I said listen up fellas. Come over here +bust it.
They said did you get it? I said yeah.
I rocked her to the left, Rocked her to the right,
She felt so good. Hugged me so tight.
I said good night.
Three days later:
Woke up fussing yelling and cussing.
Drip drip dripping and puss puss pussing.
I went to the bathroom and said: mama mia
I'm a kill that girl next time I see her.
The madder I got the more I reminice:
Why is my thing thing burning like this?
Well I remember the first day I saw that girl:
I just couldn't wait to rock her world.
I said hey good looking what you got cooking?
What have I done stuck my dick in?
Now I know why her ex boyfriend Dave
calls her misses microwave:
'Cause she was hotter than an oven and I had to learn
the hard way: stay in the microwave too long you get burned.
I went to the doctor's office; I said what have I got?
He said turn around boy and take this shot.
I looked at him like he was crazy and I said what?
Ain't nobody sticking nothing in my butt.
He turned and said in a real deep voice
have it your way if that's your choice.
And I'll put it down if you want me to put it
but don't blame me if it turns into a foot
extending from the middle of your body.
And the next time you see your cute hottie
you won't be able to screw. The only thing you can do
is just kick her so go take karate.
As I turned around to receive my injection
I said next time I'll use some protection.
If I see another girl and I get an erection
I'm walking in the other direction
'Cause I don't wanna do the sick sick dance.
So I'm keeping my prick inside my pants.
And if I see another girl and I know I can rock her
before I push up I'll make her go see the doctor.

Hey ladies in the place I'm callin' out to ya.
There never was a city kid truer and bluer.
There's more to me than you'll ever know
,And I've got more hits than Sadaharu Oh.
Tom Thumb Tom Cushman or Tom Foolery.
Date women on T V with the help of Chuck Woolery.
Words are flowin' out just like the Grand Canyon.
And I'm always out lookin' for a female companion.
I threw the lasso the tallest one and dragged her to the crib,
took off her moccasins put on my bib.
I'm wheelin' and dealin'. I make a little bit of stealin'
you back to the place and your dress I'm peelin'.
Your body's on time ,and your mind is appealin'.
Starin' at the cracks up there upon the ceilin'.
Such and such will be the bass that I'm throwin'.
Talkin' to a girl tellin' her I'm all knowin'.
She's talkin' to the kid. To the who?
I'm tellin' here every lie that you know that I never did.
Well . Me in the corner with a good lookin' daughter
I dropped my drawers and it was welcome back Kotter
We were cuttin' up the rug she started cuttin' up the carpet
In my apartment I begged her please stop it
The gift of gab is the gift that I have
And that girl ain't nothin' but a crab
Educated no stupid yes .
And when I say stupid I mean stupid fresh
I'm not James at fifteen or Chachi in charge
I'm Adam and I'm adamant about livin' large
With the white sassoons and the looks that kill
Makin' love in the back of my Coupe De Ville .
I met a little cutie she was all hopped up on zootie .
I liked the little cutie but I kicked her in the bootie .
'Cause I don't kinda go for that messin' around
You be listenin' to my records' a number one sound .
Step to the rhythm . to the ride
I've got an open mind so why you all get inside
Tune in turn on to my tune that's live
Ladies flock like fish to my line .
She's got a gold tooth . you know she's hardcore .
She'll show you a good time then she'll show you the door .
Break up with your girl it ended in tears
Vincent Van Gogh go and mail that ear .
I call her in the middle of the night when I'm drinkin'
The phone booth on the corner is damp and it's stinkin'
She said come on over it was me that she missed
I threw that trash can through her window cause you know I got dissed .
Your old lady left you and you went insane
You blew yourself up in the back of the 6 train
Take my advice at any price
a gorilla like your mother is mighty weak .
Suckin' down pints until I didn't know .
Woke up in the mornin' at the Won Ton Ho
Cause I announce I like girls that bounce
With the weight that pays about a pound per ounce .
Girls with curls and big long locks
And beatnik chicks just wearin' their smocks .
Walkin' high and mighty like she's number one and
She thinks she's the passionate one
It was Harlem at the Ruckers .
I saw you with your man .
smilin' huh . a coach bag in your hand
I was layin' in the coup with my hat turned back
We caught eyes for a moment . and that was that .
So I skated off . as you strolled off
lookin' at them legs god damn they looked so soft .
I gotta take ya from your man that's my mission .
if his love is real he got ta handle competition .
you only knew him five months .
besides he drink too much and smoke too many blunts
and I've been workin' out . everyday thinking bout you .
lookin' at my own eyes in the rear view .
catchin' flash backs of our eye contact .
wish I could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back .
I would hold ya in my arms . and ease your fears
I can't believe it . I ain't had a crush in years .
I see you at the bus stop waitin' everyday .
your man must think its safe for you to travel that way .
and I don't wanna violate your relationship
so I lay back in the cut with a crush that a trip .
still he can't stop me . from havin' day dreams .
tonguin' you down with huh . vanilla ice cream .
kissin' on your thighs under moonlight .
searchin' your body with my tongue girl all night .
I wonder one day could it be . simple dreams could turn into reality .
our love would come down so naturally .
we would walk down the isle of destiny .
what your man get his hustle on gotcha type scared .
break ya off a little chump change to do your hair .
that seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
but there's a deeper level . if you follow my lead .
Last week . I saw ya at the mall .
standin' at the pay phone bout to make a call .
I had a vision it was me . on the other end .
tellin' you come by . and then you walked in .
I touched you gently with my hands .
we talked about travelin' to distant lands .
escapin' all the madness out here in the world
becomin' my wife . no longer my girl
then . you let your dress fall down to the floor .
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more .
we experienced pleasure unparalleled .
into an ocean of love we both fell .
swimmin' in the timeless currents of pure bliss .
fantasies interchangin' with each kiss .
un . dyin' passion unites our souls .
together we swim until the point of no control
but . its a fantasy you won't come true .
we never even spoke and your man swear he love you .
so i'mma keep all these feelins' inside .
keep my dreams alive until the right time
Uhh Blue told me remind you niggaz

Now I wrote this record for when I perform
from the nights inside university dorm.
I put pen to paper with a paper to pen
for the times I'm rockin' the mic in front of women and men.
I get raw like Eddie rough like Freddy
Kreuger with a luger turnin' men into spaghetti
I'm like Fats Domino up on Blueberry Hill.
because my rhymes are funky fresh 'n not run of the mill.
just like a king has palaces I give an analysis
You can't talk because you suffer from paralysis
of the mouth of the lip of the tongue;
comin' to you complements of a brother named Young.
Now you can't talk because I'm leaving you speech less;
so be quiet let an educator teach this.
It's due to my producer so he's in a rage;
And Mike you control the vinyl I control the stage.
'cause I come off.
Four score and seven years ago
there were a whole bunch of rappers who were in the know.
Four score and seven years later
I dig a hole in those rappers like the moon with a crater
Because they battle me they're really taking a risk.
'Cause you're an eight track tape and I'm a compact disc.
And like Tyson drops boxers in rapid sucession
that how I'm droppin' M Cs in the rappin' profession
I'm comin' off just like the clothes on a hooker
and I can fly like Jimmy Super fly Snuka
Like the shuttle goes up into outer space
people's hands go up when I enter the place.
I don't mean to brag or boast just to tell ya I'm great.
but I can rock the microphone like Dorothy Hamil can skate.
Yeah I can say a funky rhyme like Greg Louganis can dive.
Don't have to be Saturday night for Young MC to get live.
'cause I come off.
No one behold Young M C struck gold.
from the rhymes that I've been sayin' to the young and the old.
From the battles I've been havin' with the smart and the dumb.
From the records I've been makin' with the mic and the drum.
You know the other rappers wanna play a game with me;
they run and hide when they hear the name of Young M C.
Like a kid playing tag that's how it's got to be;
so when I start I say Ollie Oxen free.
Yo you can never write a rhyme as strong as this one.
So pay attention 'cause you don't wanna miss one of my healthy rhymes;
nobody's are healthier New York New Jersey L A or Philadelphia
City to city and town to town place to place
country to country 'cause I get around
Even if you were in prison you da heard me play
because the warden had me rock and I'm on the P A.
So when you get out come and see my show.
and if you start static back in you go.
'Cause comin' off is the title and the theme of the jam.
and when the rhymes are finally finished people say God damn
'cause I come off.
Back to get wrecked . All respect
to those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
'Cause oh they sweat a brother majorly .
And I don't know why . your girl keeps pagin' me .
She tell me that she needs me . cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me she squeeze me lady take it . easy .
Hate to sound sleazy but tease me
I don't want it if it's that easy .
'Ey yo bust it baby got a problem sayin' bye bye
Just another hazard of a fly guy .
You ask why don't matter . my pockets got fatter .
Now everybody's lookin' for the . ladder .
And ain't no need in bein' greedy If you wanna see me
dial the beeper number baby when you need me .
And I'll be there in a . jiffy
Don't be picky just be happy with this . quickie .
But when you learn . you can't tie me down
Baby doll . check it out . I get around .
Now you can tell from my everyday fits I ain't rich
So cease and desist with them tricks .
I'm just another black man caught up in the mix .
Try'na make a dollar out of fifteen cents .
Just 'cause I'm a freak don't mean that we could hit the sheets
Baby I can see . that you don't recognize me
I'm Shock G . the one who put the satin on your panties
Never knew a hooker that could share me . I get around .
What's up love how you doin' .
Well I've been hangin' sangin' tryin' do my thang Oh . you heard that I was bangin' .
Your home girl you went to school with . that's cool
But did she tell you 'bout her sister and your cousin Thought I wasn't .
See weekends were made for Michelob .
But it's a Monday . my day . so just let me hit it yo .
And don't mistake my statement for a clown
We can keepkeep in the down low long as you know . that I get around .
Finger tips on the hips as I dip
gotta get a tight grip . don't slip . Loose lips sink ships
it's a trip . I love the way she licks her lips see me jockin'
Put a little twist in her hips 'cause I'm watchin' .
Conversations on the phone til the break of dawn
Now we all alone why the lights on? .
Turn 'em off . time to set it off get you wet and soft
Somethin's on your mind let it off .
You don't know me . you just met me . you won't let me
Well if I couldn't have it silly rabbit why you sweatin' me? .
It's a lot of real G's doin' time .
'Cause a groupy bit the truth and told a lie .
You picked the wrong guy baby if you're too fly
You need to hit the door . search for a new guy .
'Cause I only got one night in town
Break out or be clown baby doll are you down?
I get around .
When the Remi's in the system ain't no tellin'
Will I fuck 'em will I diss 'em that's what they be yellin'
I'm a pimp by blood not relation .
Y'all be chasin' I replace them huh? .
Drunk off Crist . mami on E .
Can't keep her little model hands off me .
Both in the club high singin' off key
And I wish I never met her at all
It gets better . ordered another round .

Got six model chicks . six bottles of Crist .
Four Belvederes got weed everywhere
What do you say me you and your Chloe glasses .
Go somewhere private where we can discuss fashion
Like .  Prada blouse . Gucci bra .
Filth Mart jeans . take that off .

Let's keep it real ma you savin' it for karats .
You wanna see how far I'ma go
How . much I'ma spend but you already know .
Zip zero . stingy with dinero .
Might buy you Crist but that about it .
Might light your wrist but that about it .
Fuck it I might wife you and buy you nice whips .
Ma but you really gotta ride nice dick .
Know how to work your hips and your head's priceless .
Profess you love the Hov and I'll never let you down
Get you bling like the Neptune sound .
okay . hot Hov . too hot to hold
Ladies love me long time like 2Pac's soul .
Only way to roll Jigga and two ladies
I'm too cold . Motorola two way page me .
Same song I'm back . been around the world
Ro . mancin' girls that dance with girls
From . Club Cheetah . to Club Amnesia
The Peanuts in L A . Bubblin' in Dublin
Can't deny me . why would you want to .
You need me . why don't you try me .
Baby you want to . believe me . Hov .
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
and in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call .
telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove .
for the first time in my life . I see I need love .
there I was . giggling about the games
that I had played with many hearts and i'm not saying no names .
then the thought occured tear drops made my eyes burn .
as I said to myself look what you've done to her .
I can feel it inside I can't explain how it feels .
all I know is that i'll never dish another raw deal
playing make believe pretending that I'm true .
holding in my laugh as I say that I love you .
saying amor . kissing you on the ear .
whispering I love you and i'll always be here
although I often reminisce I can't believe that I found .
a desire . for true love . floatin' around .
inside my soul because my soul is cold .
one . half of me deserves to be this way till I'm old
but the other half . needs affection and joy .
and the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy .
Romance sheer delight how sweet .
I gotta find me a girl to make my life complete .
You can scratch my back we'll get . cozy and huddle .
i'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle .
I'll give you a rose pull out your chair before we eat .
kiss you on the cheek and say ooh girl you're so sweet .
it's deja vu whenever i'm with you .
I could go on forever telling you what I do .
but where you at . you're neither here nor there
I swear I can't find you . anywhere .
damn sure ain't in my closet . or under my rug .
this love search . is really makin' me bug
and if you know who you are why don't you make yourself seen
take the chance with my love and you'll find out what I mean .
fantasy's can run . but . they can't hide
and when I find you i'm gon' pour all my love inside .
I wanna kiss you hold you never scold you just love you .
suck on you neck . caress you and rub you .
grind moan . and never be alone
if you're not standing next to me you're on the phone .
can't you hear it in my voice . I need love bad
I've got money but love's somethin' I've never had
I need your ruby red lips sweet face and all .
I love you more than a man who's ten feet tall .
I'd watch the sunrise . in your eyes
we're so in love when we hug . we become paralyzed .
our bodies explode in ecstasy unreal .
you're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel .
it's like a dream land . I can't lie I never been there .
maybe this is an experience that me and you can share .
clean and unsoiled yet . sweaty and wet .
I swear to you . this is something i'll never forget .
See what I mean I've changed I'm no longer
a play boy on the run I need something that's stronger .
friendship . trust . honor respect admiration .
this whole experience has been such a revelation .
it's taught me love and how to be a real man .
to always be considerate and do all I can .
Protect you you're my lady and you mean so much .
my body tingles all over from the slightest . touch
of your hand and understand I'll be frozen in time .
till we meet . face to face and you tell me you're mine .
if I find you girl . I swear I'll be a good man .
I'm not gonna leave it . in destiny's hands
I can't sit and wait . for my princess to arrive
I gotta struggle and fight . to keep my dream alive .
i'll search the whole world for that special girl .
when I finally find you watch our love unfurl .
seems like yesterday we used to rock the show .
I laced the track you locked the flow .
so far from hangin' on the block for dough .
Notorious they got to know that .
life ain't always what it seem to be .
words can't express what you mean to me .
even though you're gone . we still a team .
through your family I'll fulfill your dream .
in the future can't wait to see .
if you'll open up the gates for me .
reminisce some time . the night they took my friend .
try to black it out but it plays again .
when it's real feelings hard to conceal .
can't imagine all the pain I feel
give anythin' to hear half your breath .
I know you still livin' your life after death .
It's kinda hard with you not around .
know you in heaven smilin' down .
watchin' us while we pray for you .
every day we pray for you .
til the day we meet again .
in my heart is where I'll keep you friend .
memories give me the strength I need to proceed .
strength I need to believe .
my thoughts big I just can't define .
wish I could turn back the hands of time .
us in the six . shop for new clothes and kicks .
you and me takin' flicks .
makin' hits . stages they reveive you on .
still can't believe you're gone
give anythin' to hear half your breath .
I know you still livin' you're life after death .
If I ruled the world was king on the throne
I'd make peace in every culture build the homeless a home
I'm not . runnin' . for congress or the president .
I'm just here . to tell the world how my story went .
You see . first it was a dream I was livin' in Rome
And then I moved to london bought a brand new home .
And everywhere I went . I drew lots of attention
like a stretch limousine one of those new inventions
It took a few years fore the day had come .
but I was ruler of the world ranked number one .
So I headed towards washington to claim the crown .
Let the whole world know . that . the king was in town .
As I arrived the crowd started to cheer
And then someone yelled out . the king is here
so I headed toward stage to make a speech
About the new style of livin' I was gonna teach uh huh
People started flowin' as they reached for my hand .
I said . thank you for bringin' me to the promised land .
But now . I must go . say goodbye to everybody .
Tonight I'll see you all at my super dinner party .
And late that night at my super dinner party
I was dancin' to the beat and entertainin' la di da di .
The music started endin' it was time for a speech .
The crowd started sittin' as I rose from my feet .
And this was once a dream . I explained to the crowd
but now . I rule the world and I feel so very proud .
Excuse me please . for stoppin' this show
I just had . to thank you all . Huh . and me so .
My first day in office . the king on the throne
I spent my first three hours on the telephone
You know with newsmen reporters . and voters too .
I had so many calls I didn't know what to do .
You know . out that office I continued to work
I signed so many papers fingers started to hurt .
Then I shook off . the pain say this ain't no thing
'Cause there's nothin' in the world like bein' number one king
Now I rule the world and now . I'm on top .
And I'm . rollin' with folks that could never be stopped .
And I'm here to let you know this is where I belong .
To you sucker MCs that sing my song .
And it's a song that's strong about right and wrong .
And I'ma rock it to you work baby all night long
And it's a song about love . and happiness .
In a world of . peace and you know that's fresh
Now I'm the king . and I want you to know .
that I'm the master blaster rapper who's runnin' the show .
And to all . of you rappers in e . very country
You better stop what you're doin' . and listen to me .
'Cause we . gotta stop war and use unity .
to fight crime and hunger and poverty .
'Cause the African baby dyin' overseas .
while you sucker mission politicians bustin' out zs
Huh Twenty million people all enemployed
While rich man try to play pretty boy Floyd
While the workin' class just struggles hard .
Try to make ends meet . against all odds
While the poor man can't even deal with life .
you know he tried to escape and smoked the coke on the pipe .
And it's time for a change to a better way .
'Cause the sun has gotta shine through the cloudy day
So listen up world . while I teach this class
And take heed to the message or we ain't gonna last
'Cause I know . the solution . is the contribution .
Of woman and man to just join the revolution
That'll take your brain to a higher plane
And help you deal in a world that's gone insane
With the problems that I . know . we can stop
From the ruler of the world and the man on top .
But the years went by . And time was up .
And then the ruler of the world had ran out of luck .
And all the people at the time who said they were my friends
Didn't know me when my job had come . to an end .
They came up to my face as ha . ppy as can be
He was runnin' his mouth like Muhammad Ali
So I shook his hand calmly as I headed to the door
On my way to the ghetto to treat once more .
When I pull up out front you see the Benz on dubs .
When I roll twenty deep it's twenty knives in the club
Niggaz heard I fuck with Dre now they wanna show me love .
When you sell like Eminem and the hoes they wanna fuck
But homie ain't nuttin' changed hoes down Gs up
I see Xzibit in the cut hey nigga roll that weed up .
If you watch how I move you'll mistake me for a player or pimp .
Been hit wit a few shells but I don't walk wit a limp .
In the hood in L A they sayin' Fifty you hot .
They like me I want them to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York them niggaz'll tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
I'm fully focused man . my money on my mind
Got a mill out the deal and I'm still in the grind .
Now shawty said she feelin' my style she feelin' my flow .
Her girlfriend willin' to bi . and they ready to go okay! .
And you should love it . way more then you hate it
Nigga you mad? . I thought that you'd be happy I made it .
I'm that cat by the bar toastin' to the good life .
You that faggot ass nigga tryin' to pull me back right?
When my joint get to pumpin' in the club it's on
I wink my eye at ya bitch if she smiles she gone .
If the roof on fire let the motherfucker burn
If you talkin' . money homie I ain't concerned .
I'ma tell you what Banks told me
'cause go 'head switch the style up
If niggaz hate then let 'em hate then watch the money pile up .
Or we can go upside your head wit a bottle of bub .
They know where we fuckin' be .
Well now don't you tell me to smile.
You stick around I'll make it worth your while.
Like numbers beyond what you can dial.
maybe its because we're so versatile
Style, profile
I said, It always brings me back when I hear ooh child.
From The Hudson River out to the Nile;
I run the marathon to the very last mile.
Well if you battle me I feel reviled
People always sayin' my style is wild.
You've got gaul; you've got guile.
step to me I'mma rapophile
If you wanna battle you're in deni
Comin' from Uranus to check my style.
Jazz and AWOL that's our team.
Step inside the party disrupt the whole scene.
When it comes to beats well I'm a fiend.
I like my sugar with coffee and cream.
Well I gotta keep it goin' keep it goin' full steam.
To sweet to be sour to nice to be mean.
Well on the tough guy style I'm not too keen.
Trying change the world; I'mma plot and scheme.
Mario C likes to keep it clean.
Goin' to shine like a sunbeam
Keep on rappin' cause that's my dream.
Thank Moe Dee for Sticking to Themes.
We're from the family of old school hip hop
Kick off your shoes ;and relax your socks.
The rhymes will spread just like a pox.
Cause the music is loud like an electric shock.
I am known to do the wop;
Also known for the Flintstone Flop.
Tammy D gets biz on the crops.
Beastie Boys known to let the beat drop.
Now when I wrote graffiti my name was Slop.
If I rap soup my beats is stock.
Step from the table when I start to chop.
I'm the lumberjack DJ AD Rock;
If you try to knock me you'll get mocked;
I'll stir fry you in my wok.
Your knees'll start shakin' and your fingers pop;
Like a pinch on the neck from Mister Spock.
I wanna rock right now
I'm Rob Base and I came to get down
I'm not internationally known .
but I'm known to rock the microphone
because I get stupid I mean outrageous
stay away from me . if you're contagious
'cause I'm the winner . no I'm not a loser
to be an M C . is what I choose ah
ladies love me . girls adore me .
I mean even the ones who never saw me
like . the way that I rhyme at a show .
the reason why man I don't know
so let's go 'cause .
my name is Rob I gotta real funky concept .
listen up 'cause I'm gonna keep you in step .
I got an idea .
that I wanna share .
you don't like it so what . I don't care .
I'm number one . the uno I like comp .
bring all the suckers 'cause all them I'll stomp .
bold and black . but I won't protect .
all of my followers 'cause all I want is respect .
I'm not a doctor put them in rapture .
a slick brother that can easy out fox ya .
'cause I'm Rob the last name Base yeah .
and on the mic . I'm known to be the freshest .
so let's start it shouldn't be too hard .
I'm not a sucker so I don't need a body guard .
I won't fess wear a bulletproof vest .
don't smoke Buddha . can't stand Sess yes .
the situation . uh that the Base is in
I'm kinda stingy that's why I don't wanna lend .
a funky rhyme to a foe or a good friend .
but listen up . 'cause I want you to comprehend .
'cause I'm the leader . the man superior .
I take care of ya and then ya get wearier .
so just sit . my rhymes are not counterfeit .
the record sells which makes this one a hit .
it won't hurt . to listen to red alert .
take off your shirt .
make sure it don't hit the dirt .
I like the kids . the guys . the girls .
I want the ducats this is Rob Base's world .
I'm on a mission ya better just listen .

'cause .
I stand alone . don't need anyone .

only cuts the records that I say
I met this little girlie . her hair was kinda curly .
went to her house and bust her out I had to leave real early .
these girls are really sleazy . all they just say is please me .
or spend some time and rock a rhyme I said it's not that easy .
In New York the people talk and try to make us rhyme
they really hawk but we just walk because we have no time
and in the city it's a pity 'cause we just can't hide .
tinted windows don't mean nothin' they know who's inside .
when I wake up people take up mostly all of my time .
I'm not singin' phone keep ringin' 'cause I make up a rhyme
I'm not braggin' people naggin' 'cause they think I'm a star
always tearin' what I'm wearin' I think they're goin' too far
a girl named Carol follows Daryll every gig we play .
then D dissed her and dismissed her now she's jockin' jay .
I ain't lyin' girls be cryin' 'cause I'm on TV .
they even bother my poor father 'cause he's down with me .
we are not thugs we don't use drugs but you assume on your own
they offer coke and lots of dope but we just leave it alone
it's like that y'all y'all . but we don't quit
you keep on rock shock 'cause this is it .
it was all a dream . I used to read word up magazine .
Salt 'n Pepa and HeavyD up in the limousine .
Hangin' pictures on my wall .
Every Saturday rap attack mister magic Marley Marl .
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped .
Smokin' weed and bamboo Sippin' on private stock .
way back . when I had the red and black lumberjack .
With the hat to match .
Remember Rappin' Duke . duh ha duh ha
you never thought that hip hop would take it this far .
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight .
Time to get paid blow up like the world trade .
Born sinner . The opposite of a winner
Remember I used to eat sardines for dinner .
peace to Ron G Brucey B Kid Capri .
FunkMaster Flex lovebug Starsky .
I'm blowin' up . like you thought I would .
Call the crib same number same hood .
It's all good .
I made the change from a common thief .
to up close and personal with Robin Leach .
And I'm far from cheap
I smoke skunk with my peeps all day .
Spread love it's the Brooklyn way
The Moet and Alize keep me pissy .
Girls used to diss me .
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me .
I never thought it could happen this rappin' stuff .
I was too used to packin' gats and stuff
Now honies play me close Like butter play toast .
From the Mississippi down to the east coast .
Condos in queens . Indo for weeks .
Sold out seats to hear Biggie smalls speak .
Livin' life without fear .
Puttin' five karats in my baby girl's ears .
Lunches . Brunches Interviews by the pool .
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped outta high school .
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood .
And it's still all good .
Super Nintendo Sega genesis
When I was dead broke man I couldn't picture this .
Fifty inch screen money green leather sofa .
Got two rides a limousine with a chauffeur .
Phone bill about two Gs flat .
No need to worry my accountant handles that .
And my whole crew is loungin' .
Celebratin' every day no more public housin' .
Thinkin' back on my one room shack .
Now my mom pimps a ack with minks on her back .
And she loves to show me off of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source .
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat . wonder why Christmas missed us .
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip champagne when we thirstay .
Uh . Damn right I like the life I live
'Cause I went from negative to positive
and It's all .

Shank up haters wanna come after me
You aint a gangster prankster too much to eat .
Snakes in my path wanna smile up at me .
Now while you grittin' your teeth .
Frustration baby you got to breathe
Take a lot more than you to get rid of me
You see I do what they can't do I just do me
Aint no stress when it comes to stage get what you see .
Meet me in the lab pen and pad don't believe
Huh sixteens mine . create my own lines .
Love for my wordplay that's hard to find .
Sophomore I aint scared one of a kind
All I do is contemplate ways to make your fans mine .
Eyes bloodshot stressin' chills up your spine
Huh Sick to your stomach wishin' I wrote your rhymes .
Let your bones crack .
Your back pop I can't stop
Excitement .  glock shots from your stash box
Fuck it . thugged out I respect the cash route .
Locked down blast is sets while I mash out
Yeah nigga mash out D R E .
Back track think back E V E
Do you like that ooh you got to I know you .
Had you in a trance first glance from the floor too .
Don't believe I'll show you . take you with me .
Turn you on pension gone give you relief .
Put your trust in a bomb when a listen to me .
Damn she much thinner nah now I'm complete .
Still stallion . brick house pile it on
ride or Die bitch double R came strong .
Beware 'cause I crush anything I land on
Me here ain't no mistake nigga it was planned on
never mind what haters say ignore 'em 'til they fade away
amazin' they ungrateful after all the game I gave away .
safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
you still be wastin' days away nah had I never saved the day
consider them my protege . homage I think they should pay
instead of bein' gracious they violate in a major way
I never been a hater still I love 'em in a crazy way some say
they sold the yay and no they couldn't get work on labor day
it ain't that black and white it has an area that's shaded grey
I'm westside anyway even if I left today and stayed away
some move away to make a way not move away 'cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt their face away
like I once made them spray now I could make them plead their case away
been thuggin' all my life can't say I don't deserve to take a break
you'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away .
I'm the opposite of moderate immaculately polished with
the spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
allergic to the counterfeit impartial to the politics
articulate but still would grab a nigga by the collar quick
whoever having problems with their record sales just holla tip
if that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow tip
I got love for the game but ay I'm not in love with all of it
could do without the fame and rappers nowadays are comedy .
the hootin' and the hollerin' back and forth with the arguin'
where you from who you know what you make and what kind of car you in
seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
the checks into your bank account and you up out of poverty .
your values is a disarray prioritizin' horribly .
unhappy with the riches 'cause your piss poor morally
ignorin' all prior advice and fore warnin'
and we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden aren't we .
now everybody watchin' what I do . come walk in my shoes .
and see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
got my mind on my money .
and I not goin' away .
so keep on gettin' your paper . and keep on climbin' .
look in the mirror . and keep on shinin' .

Baby this ain't your typical everyday one night thing
It's a physical I'ma fuck you tonight thing

Poppin' my collar partner who in the spot?

The ones that hate me only hate me 'cause they ain't fucked me .
And they say I'm lucky you think I got time

His palms are sweaty. Knees weak. Arms are heavy.
There's vomit on his sweater already. Mom's spaghetti.
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
to drop bombs. But he keeps on forgetting
what he wrote down. The whole crowd goes so loud.
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out.
He's chokin' how?. Everybody's jokin' now.
The clock's run out. Time's up. Over. Blaow!
Snap back to reality. Op! There goes gravity. Op
There goes Rabbit. He choked. He's so mad, but he won't
give up that easy. Nope he won't have it. He knows
his whole back's to these ropes. It don't matter, he's dope,
he knows that, But he's broke. He's so stagnant. He knows
when he goes back to this mobile home that's when it's
back to the lab again yo. This whole rhapsody.
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him.
The soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking Make me king;
As we move t'ward a new world order
A normal life is boring but superstardom's
close to post mortem it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter he blows it's all over
These hoes is all on him. Coast to coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter Lonely roads
God only knows he's grown farther from home he's no father
he goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo' he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows.
He nose dove and sold nada . And so the soap opera
is told, it unfolds I suppose it's old partner
But the beat goes on da da dum da dum da da .
No more games I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the begi the mood all changed.
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
fact that I can't get by with my nine to
five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie there's no Mekhi Phifer This is my life.
And these times are so hard . and it's gettin' even harder
Try'na feed and water my seed plus . teeter totter
caught up between bein' a father and a primadonna
Baby momma drama screamin' on her too much for me to wanna
stay in one spot . Another day of monotony's
gotten me . to the point I'm like a snail I've got
to formulate a plot . or end up in jail or shot .
Success is my only motherfuckin' option . failure's not .
Mom I love you but this trailer's got
to go I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot .
So here I go it's my shot . feet fail me not .
this may be the only opportunity that I got .
Uh Pussy ass nigga stop hatin' .
Lil Tunechi that fire .
and these hoes love me like satan Man .
Eh . Fuck with me and get bodied .
And all she eat is dick . She's on a strict diet
That's my baby . with no makeup she a ten .
And she the best with that head
even better than Karrine
She don't want money .
She want the time we could spend .
She said 'cause I really need somebody .
So tell me you're that somebody
Girl I fuck who I want . and fuck who I don't .
Got that A1 credit . that's that fillet mignon
She said I never wanna make you mad .
I just wanna make you proud
I said baby just make me cum . Then don't make a sound .
Uh Real nigga fuck these haters .
These hoes got pussies like craters .
Can't treat these hoes like ladies Man .
Pussy money weed codeine
she say my dick feel like morphine
I hope my name taste like sardines To these niggas .
She wake up eat this dick .
Call that breakfast in bed . Sixty nine ninety six .
I feel her heartbeat . I chest to chest with this bitch .
Now turn around face down I'm arrestin' this bitch .
Yeah All my bitches love me . And I love all my bitches .
But it's like soon as I cum . I come to my senses
And I would say these hoes name .
but then I would be snitchin'
And these haters try to knock me
but they can't knock me off the hinges Lil Tunechi .
I lost a few good bitches .
Met some more bad bitches
and I be schoolin' them niggas .
Pose for your class picture
Now kiss my ass if you hatin' .
I'm gettin' ass I'm skatin' .
I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels . like .
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe .
I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight .
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight .
High off her love drunk from her hate .
it's like I'm huffin' paint
And I love her the more I suffer . I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown she resuscitates . me
she fuckin' hates me . and I love it wait! .
Where you goin' I'm leavin' you! . No you ain't!
Come back we're runnin' right back here we go a gain
It's so insane 'cause when it's goin' good it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful . I feel so ashamed
I snapped who's that dude? . I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her . I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength .
You ever love somebody so much .
you can barely breathe when you're wit 'em
You meet . and neither one of you . even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin'
yeah them chills used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em? .
You swore you'd never hit 'em never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em .
You push pull each other's hair scratch claw bit 'em
Throw 'em down pin 'em
so lost in them moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over it controls ya both
so they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today . that was yesterday . yesterday is over
It's a different day . Sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her . next time you'll show restraint .
You don't get another chance life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane .
Now I know we said things did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns . same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is .
you're the same as me When it comes to love
you're just as blinded . baby please
come back . it wasn't you baby it was me
maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much . to walk away though .
Come inside pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity . in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time there won't be no next time
I apologize even though I know it's lies .
I'm tired of the games I just want her back
I know I'ma liar If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again .
I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire just
had a fly girl flo called her honey .
next thing she spent up all my money .
left you in debt you and your girl's dizzy .
stopped movin' crack but you're still gettin' pissy .

like you was Lois Lane and I was Clark Kent .

All you do is defend that lady . when I call you. .
Ten times out of nine . Now if I'm lyin' find .

Together dream bout that crib with the goodyear swing .

Kiss my ass; . bust the cap on the Moet .
'Cause I don't wanna hear that crap .
I'd rather be a New Jack Hustler .
What's up?; You say you wanna be down?.
Ease back . or motherfucker get beat down;
Out my face . fool I'm the illest
Bulletproof . I die harder than Bruce Willis .
Got my crew in effect I bought 'em new Jags;
So much cash . gotta keep it in Hefty bags.
All I think about is keys and Gs. .
Imagine that . me workin' in Mickey Ds; .
That's a joke cause I'm never gonna be broke. .
When I die there'll be bullets and gunsmoke .
You don't like my liestyle Fuck you. .
I'm rollin' with the New Jack crew.
Here I come . so you better break North.
As I stride my gold chains glide back and forth.
I care nothin' 'bout you and that's evident
All I love is my dope and Dead Presidents .
Sound crazy . Well it isn't
The ends justifies the means that's the system .
I learned that in school then I dropped out;
Hit the streets, checked the grip, and now I got clout. .
I had nothin' and I wanted it; .
You had everything and you flaunted it. .
Turned the needy into the greedy
With cocaine . my success came speedy .
Got me twisted jammed into a paradox .
every dollar I get another brother drops; .
maybe that's the plan and I don't understand
God damn . you got me sinkin' in quicksand .
But since I don't know . and I ain't never learned; .
I gotta get paid; . I got money to earn.
With my posse out on the ave; .
Bump my sounds crack a forty and laugh. .
Cool out and watch my new Benz gleam.
Is this a nightmare . Or the American dream?.
So think twice if you're comin' down my block.
You wanna journey through hell?; Well shit gets hot.
Pregnant teens; children's screams; 
Life is weighed on the scales of a triple beam. .
You don't come here much and you better not;
Wrong move BANG . ambulance cot. .
I gotta get more money than you got; .
So what if some motherfucker gets shot?. .
That's how the game is played;
another brother slain; The wound is deep
BUT they're givin' us a Band Aid. .
My education low but I got long dough.
I'm raised like a Pit Bull my heart pumps Nitro .
Sleep on silk; lie like a politician
My Uzi my best friend; cold as a mortician .
Lock me up it's genocidal catastrophe .
There'll be another one after meː
a hustler .
So I ball so hard muh'er fuckers wanna fine me; .
first niggaz gotta find me. .
What's fifty grand to a muh'er fucker like me?;
Can you please remind me?.

Prince Williams ain't do it right . if you ask me; .
'Cause I was him I woulda married Kate and Ashley
What's Gucci my nigga . What's Louie my killa .
What's drugs my dealer . What's that jacket Margiela .
Doctors say I'm the illest .

You know how many hot bitches I own?. .

I know I'm 'bout to kill it; How you know? I got that feelin' .
are now watchin' the throne. don't let me into my zone. .
don't let me into my zone. I'm definitely in my zone.
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin' I do it;
I don't give a damn what you think; I'm doin' this for me
so fuck the world feed it beans; It's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me.
I'ma be what I set out to be; without a doubt undoubtedly
;And all those who looked down on me I'm tearin' down your balcony
No if ands or buts; don't try to ask him why or how can he;
From infinite down to that last relapse album he's still shittin'
whether he's on salary paid hourly
until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him;
whichever comes first, for better or worse.
He's married to the game; like a fuck you for christmas
his gift is a curse.
okay quit playin' with the scissors and shit and cut the crap.
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm
for you to know it's a wrap.
You said you was king; you lied through your teeth;
for that fuck your feelings
instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped.
And to the fans: I'll never let you down again I'm back;
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact let's be honest that last relapse CD was eh;
perhaps I ran them accents into the ground;
relax I ain't goin' back to that now.
All I'm tryin' to say is get back click clack blaow ;
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how;
I'm way too up to back down ;
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out.
It was my decision to get clean; I did it for me;
admittedly I pro'bly did it subliminally for you;
so I could come back a brand new me.
You helped see me through
And don't even realize you did 'cause believe me you:
I've been through the wringer
;but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye; I feel like the king of
my world. haters can make like bees with no stingers
and drop dead. No more beef lingers
No more drama From now on I promise
to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
and raise it; you couldn't lift a single shingle on it.
'Cause the way I feel I'm strong enough to go to the club
or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up;
Cause I'm raising the bar.
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars.
I feel amazing and I'm not afraid
One . two . three and to the . fo' .
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Doctor Dre is at the . do' .
Ready to make an entrance so back on up .
'cause you know we're bout to rip shit up .
Gimme the microphone first so I can bust like a bubble .
Compton and Long Beach together
now you know you in trouble .
Ain't nuttin' but a G thang baby .
Two loc'ed out niggaz so we're crazy .
Death Row is the label that pays me .
Unfadeable so please don't try to . fade this
But uh back to the lecture at hand .
Perfection is perfected so'ma let em understand .
from a young G's perspective .
And before me dig out a bitch I have to find a contraceptive .
You never know she could be earnin' her man
and learnin' her man . and at the same time burnin' her man
Now you know I ain't with that shit Lieutenant .
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it .
And that's realer than Real Deal Holy field .
And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel .
Well if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff .
Well I'm peepin' and I'm creepin' and I'm . creep in .
But I damn near got caught . 'cause my beeper kept beepin'
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt .
So sit back relax and strap on your seatbelt
You never been on a ride like this befo' .
with a producer who can rap and control the maestro .
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I . kick .
You know and I know I flow some ol' funky shit .
to add to my collection the selection symbolizes dope
take a toke but don't choke
If you do . you'll have no clue
on what me and my homey Snoop Dogg came to do .
Fallin' back on that ass with a hellafied gangsta lean .
Gettin' funky on the mic like a old batch of collard greens .
It's the capital S oh yes I'm fresh N double O P .
D O double G Y D O double G ya see .
Showin' much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimpin' hoes and clockin' a grip like my name was Dolomite .
Yeah . and it don't quit .
I think they in the mood for some motherfuckin' G shit .
So Dre . Whattup Dog
Gotta give em what they . want . What's that G?
We gotta break em off somethin' Hell yeah!
and it's gotta be bumpin' City of Compton .
It's where it takes place so when asked yo' attention
Mobbin' like a muh'fucker but I ain't lynchin'
Droppin' the funky shit
that's makin' the sucka niggaz mumble .
When I'm on the mic it's like a cookie they all . crumble
Try to get close and your ass'll get smacked .
My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back .
Never let me slip 'cause if I slip then I'm slippin' .
But if I got my Nina then you know I'm straight trippin' .
And I'ma continue to put the rap down put the mack down .
And if you bitches talk shit . I'll have to put the smack down
Yeah . and you don't stop .
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock .
But I'm never off always on to the break of dawn
C O M P T O N and the city they call Long Beach .
Puttin' the shit together .
Like my nigga D O C No One Can Do it better .

Catch a date suck a dick shit TRICK
Had to play catch by myself . what a sorry sight .
A pitiful plight so I pray . for a starry night
Please send me a pops before puberty
the things I wouldn't do to see a piece of family uni ty .
Moms always work I barely see her .
I'm startin' to get worried without a pops I'll grow to . be her .
It's a wonder they don't understand kids today .
so when I pray . I pray I'll never grow to be that way .
And I hope that he answers me .
I heard God don't like ugly well take a look at my family .
A different father every weekend .
Before we get to meet him they break up before the week ends .
I'm gettin' sick of all the freind ships .
As soon as we kick it he done split and the whole shit ends quick .
How can I be a man if there's no role model .
Strivin' to save my soul I stay cold drinkin' a forty bottle
so sorry .
Moms had to entertain many men
Didn't wanna do it but it's time to pay the rent again
I'm gettin' a bit . older and I'm startin' to be a bother .
Moms can't stand me 'cause I'm lookin' like my father .
Should I stay or run away tell me the answer
Moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer .
Grow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff .
Moms was tough . 'causec poppa wasn't man enough .
Couldn't stand up . to his own responsibilities
stead of takin' care of me he'd rather live lavishly .
That's why I'll never be a father .
unless you got the time it's a crime don't even bother .
That's when I started hatin' the phony smiles
Said I was an only child Look at mama's lonely smile .
It's hard for a son to see his mother cry
She only loves you but has to fuck with these other guys .
I'm so sorry .
Man child in the promised land couldn't afford many heroes .
Moms was the only one there my pops was a no show .
And oh . I guess ya didn't know
that I would grow to be so strong .
Lookin' kinda pale was it the ale oh pops was wrong
Where was the money that you said . you would send me
talked on the phone and you sounded so friendly
Ask about school and my welfare .
but it's clear you ain't sincere hey who the hell cares .
You think I'm blind but this time I see you comin' Jack .
You grabbed your coat left us broke now ain't no runnin' back .
Askin' bout my moms like you loved her from the start .
Left her in the dark she fell apart from a broken heart .
So don't even start . with that wanna be your father shit .
Don't even bother with your dollars I don't need it .
I'll bury moms like you left me all alone G .
Now that I finally you stay the Fuck away from me
so sorry .
I never meant to leave but I was wanted
Crossed too many people every house I'd touch was haunted .
Had to watch the strangers every brother was a danger
If I was to keep you breathin' . had to be out of range uh .
Had to move one to lost my name and pick the number .
Made me watch my back I had no happy home to run to .
Maybe it's my fault for bein' a father livin' fast .
But livin' slow mean half the dough and won't you kissin' ass .
Hindsight shows me it was wrong all along .
I wanted to make some dough so you would grow to be so strong .
It took a little longer than I thought .
I slipped got caught . and sent to jail by the courts .
Now I'm doin' time and I wish you'd understand .
all I ever wanted was for you to be a man .
and grow to be the type you was meant to be .
Keep the war fightin' by the writings that you sent to me
I'm so sorry .
I remember one year
my mom took me school shoppin'
it was me my brother my mom oh my pop and my little sister
all hopped in the car .
we headed downtown to the gallery mall .
my mom started buggin' with the clothes she chose
I didn't say nothin' at first
I just turned up my nose .
she said what's wrong this shirt . cost twenty dollars
I said mom . this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar .
the next half hour was the same old thing
my mother buyin' me clothes from nineteen sixty three
and then she lost her mind and did the ultimate .
I asked her for adidas and she bought me zips
I said mom what are you doin' . ya ruin my rep
she said you're only sixteen you don't have a rep yet
I said mom let's put these clothes back please
she said no . you go to school to learn not for a fashion show .
I said this isn't sha na na come on mom i'm not bowzer
mom please put back the bell bottom Brady bunch trousers .
but if you don't want to I can live with that but
you gotta put back . the double knit reversible slacks .
she wasn't moved everything stayed the same .
inevitably the first day of school came .
I thought I could get over . I tried to play sick .
but my mom said no no way . uh . forget it
there was nothin' I could do . I tried to relax
I got dressed up in those ancient artifacts
and when I walked into school . it was just as I thought
the kids were crackin' up . laughin' at the clothes mom bought .
and those who weren't laughin' still had a ball
cause they were pointin' and whisperin'
as I walked down the hall
I got home and told my mom how my day went .
she said if they were laughing you don't need them
'cause they're not good friends .
for the next six hours I tried to explain to my mom .
that I was gonna have to go through this about . two hundred more times .
so to you all the kids all across the land .
there's no need to argue
parents just don't understand .
Oh kay . here's the situation .
my parents went away on a week's vacation and .
they left the keys to the brand new porsche .
would they mind
um well of course not .
I'll just take it for a little spin
and maybe show it off to a couple of friends .
i'll just cruise it around the neighborhood
well maybe I shouldn't .
yeah of course I should .
pay attention here's the thick of the plot
I pulled up to the corner at the end of my block .
that's when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walkin'
I picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talkin' .
you should've seen this girl's bodily dimensions
I honked my horn just to get her attention
she said . was that for me
I said yeah
she said why
I said come on and take a ride with a helluva guy .
she said how do I know you're not sick .
you could be some deranged lunatic .
I said c'mon toots . my name is the Prince
beside would a lunatic have a porsche like this .
she agreed and we were on our way .
she was lookin' very good and so was I . must say word .
we hit mcdonald's . pulled into the drive
we ordered two big macs and two large fries with cokes .
she kicked her shoes off . onto the floor
she said . drive fast speed turns me on
she put her hand on my knee . I put my foot on the gas
we almost got whiplash I took off so fast .
the sun roof was open . the music was high
and this girl's hand was steadily movin' up my thigh
she had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far .
I guess that's why I didn't notice that police car .
we're doin' ninety in my mom's new porsche
and to make this long story short . short .
when the cop pulled me over I was scared as hell
I said I don't . have a license but I drive very well officer .
almost had a heart attack that day .
come to find out the girl . was a twelve year old runaway .
I was arrested . the car was impounded .
there was no way for me to avoid bein' grounded .
my parents had to come off from vacation to get me .
I'd rather be in jail than to have my father hit me .
my parents walked in
I got my grip I said ah mom dad . how was your trip .
they didn't speak I said I want to plead my case
but my father just shoved me in the car by my face
that was a hard ride home . I don't know how I survived
they took turns . one would beat me while the other was drivin' .
I can't believe it I just made a mistake
well . parents are the same no matter time nor place .
so to you all the kids all across the land .
take it from me . parents just don't understand
check it out . 'cause ice is rhymin' .
to the top I keep on climbin'
suckers . thought I couldn't swing this .
now I rock the crowd and get a pump fist
go ice . everybody is sayin' .
to the funky beat that's playin'
if you wanna stop me you can't hang .

my muffler's draggin' my suspension's gettin' weak
now the freaks are gettin' hungry and MixaLot's treatin' .
we stopped at taco bell for some Mexican eatin'
but taco bell was closed the girls was on my tip .
they said go back the other way we'll stop and eat at Dick's .
Dick's is the place where the crew hang out .
the swass like to play and the rich flaunt clout .
posse to the burger stand so big we walk in twos
we're gettin' dirty looks from those other sucka crews
kid sensation dropped a twenty . and didn't even miss it

her boyfriend's illin' he went to slap her face .
my homeboy P L B cold sprayed the boy with mace
'cause I never liked a punk . who beat up on his girl

you're broke cole cryin' bout the rock man blues .
you beat up on your girl . and now you're all upset
she's with the MixALot posse on the Broadway set .
all my life I wanted to make it to the top .
some said I wouldn't they told me no but I didn't stop .
workin' hard makin' those moves every day .
and on my knees every night you know I pray .
now I just think that you can do what ever you want .
I'm bustin' these rhymes making this money and I won't .
forget my people or my town or my ways .
and on my knees every night I'm still gon' pray .
time and time and time and time and time again .
I kept on knockin' but these people wouldn't let me in .
I tried and tried and tried and tried to make a way .
but nothin' happened 'til that day that I prayed .
children dyin' oh so fast from this or that .
need that money walkin' that dope smokin' that crack .
ten years old stand outside better look out .
dead and gone . never had a chance . what's it all about .
on a mission start to doubt here we go .
kicking back read these words we need to know .
livin' high livin' good livin' long .
take a minute bust a prayer and you're good to go .
Now as I get to school I hear the late bell ringin'
runnin' through the hall I hear the glee club singin'
;get to the office I can hardly speak
'cause it's the third late pass that I got this week.
So to my first class I run and don't walk;
all I hear is my sneakers and the scratchin' of chalk.
And when I get to the room I hear the teacher say:
Mister Young I'm happy that a you could join us today
I try to sit down so I can take some notes
but I can't read what the kid next to me wrote.
and if that wasn't enough to make my morning complete
as I try to get up I find this gum on my seat.
Now with the seat stuck to me I raised my hand
and said excuse me but can I go to the bathroom maam?.
the teacher got upset and she screamed out no
it's off to the principal's office you go.
Twelve o'clock comes with mass hysteria
everybody rushes down to the cafeteria
picked up my tray to have Thursday's lunch
and when I tried the apple sauce I heard it crunch.
I'm runnin' up the stairs with my front tooth broken
the nurse just laughed and said you must be jokin'
I looked up at her with a smile on my face
no joke 'cause my front tooth is out of place.
so I walked to school with ice on my lip;
a nurse's late pass like a gun on my hip.
my books are real heavy I'm walkin' I'm draggin' it
no school lunch next week I'm brown baggin' it.
forget class I'm a shoot some ball;
with the late pass I got no trouble at all.
but then the nurse walks up and says what do you know:
it's off to the principal's office you go.
passin' notes is my favorite time;
I can't wait to find a girl to pass mine
to to express my feelin'
give me a week me and the girl will be dealin'
now one young lady was lookin' at me;
I said hi my name is Marvin known as Young MC
but then the bell rang and the teacher came in
and that's when the game of passin' notes would begin
I wrote the first note told her she was fine
and I hoped that the two of us could spend some time;
she wrote me back and told me you're fine too I'd love
to go on a date and spend some time with you.
so then I sat there reelin' and lookin' at the ceilin'
words can't express the way that I was feelin'
then I thought to myself the sure way to get her
is to write another note oh yes a love letter
when I finished the note it was ready to pass;
the teacher took it and read it right in front of the class.
she read it word by word and line by line
and everybody who was laughin' was a friend of mine.
even my girl was laughin' it was too late
for me to write another note 'cause there would be no date.
the teacher looked at me and I said I know
it's off to the principal's office I go.

I said you need a man . who's got finesse .
and his whole name . across his chest

but can he rock a party 'til the early light
he can't satisfy you with his little worm .

it was twelve o'clock and one Friday night
I was rockin' to the beat feelin' all right
everybody was dancin' . on the floor
doin' all the things they never did before
and then this fly fly girl with a sexy lean
she came into the bar she came into the scene .
as she travelled deeper inside the room
all the fellas checked out . her white sassoons
she came up to the table looked into my eyes
then she turned around . and shook her behind
so I said to myself it's time for me to release .
my vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
and now people in the house this is just for you .
a little rap to make you boogaloo
now the group you hear is called phase two
and let me tell you somethin' we're a helluva crew .
once a week uh we're on the street
just to cut in the jams . and look at your feet
for ya you to party gotta have the moves
so we'll get right down and get you a groove
for you to dance . you got to be hot
so we'll get right down and make you rock
now the system's on and the girls are there .
you definitely have . a rockin' affair
but let me tell you somethin' there's still one fact
and to have a party got to have a rap
so when the party's over . you're makin' it home .
and tryin' to sleep before the break of dawn
and while you're sleepin' you start to dream .
and thinkin' how you danced on the disco scene .
my name appears . in your mind
yeah a name you know that was right on time
it was phase two uh just uh doin' a do .
rockin' you down 'cos you knew we could
to the rhythm of the beat that makes you freak
uh come alive girls . uh get on your feet .
uh to the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
to the double beat beat that makes you freak
uh to the rhythm of the beat that says you go on .
on 'n on into the break of dawn
now I got a man comin' on right now .
he's guaranteed . to throw down
he goes by the name of uh wonder mike .
come on wonder mike do what you like .
I say a can of beer that's sweeter than honey
like a millionaire . that has no money
like a rainy day that is not wet .
like a gamblin' fiend that does not bet .
like Dracula . without his fangs
like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
like collard greens that don't taste good .
like a tree that's not made out of wood .
like goin' up . and not comin' down .
is just like the beat without the sound on sound
to the beat . beat . you do the freak
everybody just rock and dance to the beat .
have you ever went over a friends house to eat .
and the food just ain't no good .
I mean the macaroni's soggy the peas are mushed
and the chicken tastes like wood .
uh so you try to play it off like you think you can
by uh sayin' that you're full .
and then your friend says mama he's just being polite
he ain't finished uh uh that's bull .
so your heart starts pumpin' and you think of a lie
and you say that you already ate .
and your friend says man there's plenty of food
so you pile some more on your plate .
while the stinky food's steamin' your mind starts to dreamin'
of the moment it's time to leave .
and then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rottin'
into somethin' that looks like cheese .
oh so you say that's it I gotta leave this place
I don't care what these people think .
I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous
with this ugly food that stinks .
uh so you bust out the door while it's still closed
still sick from the food you ate .
and then you run to the store for quick relief
from a bottle of kaopectate .
and then you call your friend uh two weeks later .
to see how he has been .
and he says I understand about the food
baby bubba but we're still friends .
with a hip . hop . the hippie to the hippie
the hip hip a hop a you don't stop the rockin'
to the bang bang boogie

I said uh hank . uh can ya rock .
can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop
uh can ya hip me to . the shoobie doo
I said uh come on make me make the people move .
I go to the halls and then ring the bell
because I am the man with the clientele
and if ya ask me why . I rock so well
a big bang . I got clientele
uh from the time I was only six years old .
I never forgot . what I was told
it was the best advice . that I ever had .
it came from my wise dear old dad
he said sit down punk I wanna talk to you .
and don't say a word . til I'm through
now there's a time to laugh . a time to cry .
a time to live and a time to die .
a time to break and a time to chill .
to act civilized or act real ill
but whatever you do . in your lifetime .
you never let an MC steal your rhyme
so from six to six 'til this very day .
i'll always remember what he had to say
so when the sucker MCs try to chump my style .
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style finesse and a little black book .
that's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look
but the thing that seperates you from me .
and that is called originality
because my rhymes are on . from what you heard .
I didn't even bite not a god damn word
and I say a little more later on tonight .
so the sucker MCs can bite all night

Hip hop I'm the heart of that .
Nigga nothin' short of that .
President Carter young money democrat
I feel like I'm walkin' a tight rope without a circus net;
Poppin' percocet I'm a nervous wreck.
I deserve respect but I work and sweat for this worthless check.
bout to burst this tech at somebody to reverse this debt.
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged.
My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams;
I'm hopin' things look up but there ain't no job openings
I feel discouraged hungry and malnourished
Living in this house with no furnace unfurnished
And I'm sick of workin' dead end jobs with lame pay;
And I'm tired of being hired and fired the same day.
But fuck it if you know the rules to the game play
'cause when wi die we know we all going the same way.
Cause it's cool to be the player but it sucks to be the fan,
when all you need is bucks to be the man, plus a luxury sedan
comfortable roomy in a six;
But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics
who walk around depressed and smoke a pound of sess a day.
And yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today
My daughter wants to throw the ball but I'm too stressed to play.
There's people that love me and people that hate me
but it's the evil that made me
this backstabbin' deceitful and shady
I want the money the women the fortune and fame;
if it means I end up burnin' in hell scorchin' in flames;
if it means I'm stealin' your checkbook and forgin' your name
This lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain;
Cause right now I feel like just hit the rock bottom
I got problems now everybody on my blocks got 'em.
I'm screamin' like them two cops when Tupac shot 'em.
Holdin' two glocks hope your doors got new locks on 'em.
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em.
And them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on 'em;
And while you flaunt 'em
I could be takin' 'em to shops to pawn 'em;
I got a couple of rings and a brand new watch you want 'em?.
Cause I ain't never went gold off one song;
I'm runnin' up on someone's lawn with guns drawn.
yo E M D .
yeah what's up man .
there go that girl they call Roxanne . she's all stuck up
why do you say that .
'cause she wouldn't give a guy like me no rap
well she was walkin' down the street so I said hello .
I'm . Kangol from U T F O and she said so
I said so . baby don't you know
I can sing rap and dance in just one show
'cause I'm . Kangol . mister sophisticater .
as far as know ain't nobody greater
from beginning to end end . to beginning .
I never lose because I'm all about winning
but if I was to lose . I wouldn't be upset .
'cause I'm not a gambler I don't bet
I don't be in no casino . and baby while you knizz oh
the is uh I is the griz uh eat kizz uh and kizz oh
I thought she'd be impressed by my 'm devious rap .
I thought I had her caught 'cause I'm a sinister trap
I thought it'd be a piece of cake but it was nothing like that
I guess that's what I get for thinking ain't that right black .
then crizz I . to gizz oh . and seen this number whiz uh .
crizzin' with rocking tizza of mizzac the mic to dizz uh
with the . bang bang brother I feel bad .
but I ain't committing suicide for no crab .
calling her a crab is just a figure of speech
'cause she's an apple . a pear . a plum and a peach .
I thought I had it in the palm of my hand .
but man oh man if I was grand I'd bang Roxanne .
you Kangol I don't think that you're dense .
but you went about the matter with no experience
you should know . she doesn't need a guy like you
she needs a guy like me . with a high I Q .
and she'll take to my rap 'cause my rap's the best .
the educated rapper M D will never fess .
so when I met her I wasted no time
but stuck up Roxanne . paid me no mind .
she thought my name was Barry . I told her it was Gary .
she said she didn't like it so she chose to call me Barry .
she said she'd love to marry . my baby she would carry .
and if she had a baby she'd name the baby Harry
her mother's name is baby which is really quite contrary .
her face is really hairy . and you can say it's scary .
so isn't not every . her father's a fairy .
his job is secondary in some some military .
he throws them to electric camp that wasn't voluntary .
his daughter's name is Sherry . his sons are Tom and Jerry .
Jerry had the flu but it was only temporrary .
back in January . or was it February .
but every time I say this rhyme it makes me kinda weary .
it's only customary . to give this commentary .
some say it's bad some say it's legendary .
you search in' all you want try your local library .
you'll never find a rhyme like this in any dictionary .
but do you know . after all that .
all I received was a pat on the back .
that's what you get . it happened to me
ain't that right mix master I C E .
you thought you had a rose . you thought you was cupid .
but EMD your rap was plain stupid .
I know you're educated . but when will you learn .
not all girls want to be involved with bookworms
you gotta be strong in way she can't resist
so educated rapper huh . bust this .
since she's a new girl . around the block .
I had to let her know that I'm the debonoir doc
I said i'd like to speak to you . if I can .
and if I'm correct here your name is Roxanne
she said how'd you know my name I said it's getting around .
right now baby you're the talk of the town
please let me walk you to the corner . my rap will be brief
she said i've seen you before . you look like a thief
I said me . the Doc . a hood . a rock .
running 'round the street robbing people on the block
nah that's not my style . that crime I'm not related .
as far as I'm concerned I'm too sophisticated
then it seemed I got busy 'cause she cracked a smile .
that let me know my rap was worth her while
she said you call yourself a doctor I said this is true
she said explain to me really what doctors must do
I said this is very rare 'cause I don't say this every day
there's a million medical skills a doctor displays .
dermatology is treatment of the skin .
infected and you'll see me over and over again
there's enthesiology . opthomology .
internal medicine and plastic surgery
orthopedic surgery and pathology
a disease involves a change of the body
she said ooh . that's very unique .
gave me her number and kissed me on the cheek .
she said she had to go but she'd be back by eight .
so to call her at nine to arrange a date .
did you take her to the beach
that's what we planned .
but she stood me up . Roxanne Roxanne .
it's called the rump shaker . the beats is like sweeter than candy .
I'm feelin' manly and your shaker's comin' in handy .
slide 'em across from new york down by your Virginia .
ticklin' you around Delaware before I enter .
turn to seduction from face hips to feet .
a wiggle and a jiggle can make the night complete .
now since you got the body of the year come and get the award .
here's a hint it's like a long sharp sword .
flip tail so let me see you shake it up like dice
the way you shake your rump is turnin' mighty men to mice .
but a plus got a surprise that's a back breaker .
now let me see you shake your rump like a rump shaker .
yup yup it's Teddy . ready with the one two checker .
wrecks in effect is in effects but I'm the wrecker
of the track 'bout the honey shakin' rumps and they backs in .
booties of the cuties steady shakin' but relaxin' .
the action . is packed in a jam like a closet
beats bound to get you up cold flowin' like a faucet .
not mean to make you sit . not mean to make you jump
but yep make the hotties in the party shake your rump
I like the way you comb your hair . uh .
I like the stylish clothes you wear . uh .
it's just the little things you do . uh .
that makes me wanna get with you . uh .
shake it shake it shake it now shake it .
she can spend every birthday butt naked .
body is soft makin' me wanna squish her .
more just than a game a rumper like a sub woofer .
shake it to the left . shake it to the right .
I don't mind stickin' it to her every single night .
come on pass the poom poom send it to poppa .
shake it baby shake it baby shake it don't stop uh .
let me see you do the booty hop .
and now make the booty stop .
now drop and do the booty wop .
the way you shakin' your reals willy peel
is makin' Brazils of a whole lot of bills .
but I ain't into trickin' . just to treatin' .
and I ain't into treatin' every trick that I'm meetin' .
nah nah nah na nah na na
yeah shake it baby shake it now shake it like that .
now little lisa's only nine years old .
she's tryin' to figure out why the world is so cold .
why she's all alone and they never met her family .
momma's always gone and she never met her daddy .
part of her is missin' and nobody'll listen .
momma's on drugs gettin' high up in the kitchen .
bringin' home men at different hours of the night .
startin' with some laughs usually end in' in a fight .
sneakin' in her room when her momma's knocked out .
tryin' to have his way and little Lisa says ouch .
she tries to resist but then all he does is beat her .
tries to tell her mom but her momma don't believe her .
lisa's stuck up in a world on her own .
forced to think that hell is a place called home .
nothin' else to do but get some clothes and pack .
she says she's 'bout to run away and never come back .
little Nicole is only ten years old
she's steady tryin' to figure why the world is so cold
why she's not pretty and nobody seems to like her .
alcoholic stepdad always wanna strike her .
yells and abuses . leaves her with some bruises .
teachers ask questions she's makin' up excuses .
bleedin' on the inside cryin' on the out .
it's only one girl really knows what she's about .
her name is little Stacy and they become friends .
promise that they'll always be tight 'til the end .
until one day lil' Stacy gets shot .
a drive by bullet went stray up on her block .
now Nicole's stuck up in a world on her own .
forced to think that hell is a place called home .
nothin' else to do but get her clothes and pack .
she says she's 'bout to run away and never come back .
little Erica is eleven years old
she's steady tryin' to figure why the world is so cold .
so she pops X to get rid of all the pain .
plus she's havin' sex with her boy who's sixteen .
emotions run deep as she thinks she's in love .
so there's no protection he's usin' no glove .
never thinkin' bout the consequences of her actions
livin' for today and not tomorrow's satisfaction
the days go by and her belly gets big .
the father bails out he ain't ready for a kid .
knowin' her momma would blow it all out of proportion
plus she lives poor so no money for abortion .
Erica is stuck up in a world on her own .
forced to think that hell is a place called home .
nothin' else to do but get her clothes and pack .
she says she 'bout to run away and never come back .
When it hurt I ease the pain girl . caress your frame
get them worries off your brain girl . I'm in your corner
do what you want it's your thing girl . I persist and try but .
one in the same girl . it ain't a game
so I can't play with you . I wanna lay with you

in good and bad times . we'll always make it through .
'cause what we got is true . no matter what they say to you
I could straight lace you not just appearance .
stimulate your mind strengthen your spirits .
be the voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it .
you want it but you fear it but you love it when you near it .
sit her on the sofa get a little closer .
touch you right do it like a man's suppose to .
knew you was the one that's why I chose you .
'cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier .
Your soul ain't a toy you ain't dealin' with a boy .
feel emptiness inside . I can fill that void .
when you spend time with your woman and listen .
it shines more than any baguette . diamond can glisten
I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth .
'cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself .
I'd rather show you it's heartfelt . make your heart melt .
and prove to you you're more important than anything else .
worthwhile special like my first child .
when I see your face it's always like the first time .
our eyes met . I knew we'd be together in a tri jet .
I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet .
hold you . mold you . don't know let me show you .
ain't no tellin' what we could grow to .
let it be known I told you .
and I'mma be there for whatever you go through . my love's true .
I'm the light when you can't see .
I'm that air when you can't breathe .
I'm that feeling when you can't leave .
some doubt . some believe . some lie cheat and deceive
so it's only you and me .
when you weak I'll make you strong . here's where you belong .
I ain't perfect but I promise I won't do you wrong .
keep you way from harm . my love is protected .
I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected .
I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare
in the moment of despair I'm the courage when you're scared .
loyal . down for you . soon as I saw you
wanted to be there 'cause I could hold it down for you .
be around for you . plant seeds in the soil .
make love all night bending bed coils .
you're a queen . therefore I treat you royal .
this is all for you . 'cause I . simply adore you .
I tell her . now go in pop that pussy for a real nigga
I already know that life is deep but I still dig her .
Niggaz is jealous . But really I could care less .
I'm in hell's kitchen with an apron and a hairnet .
Devil on my shoulder . The lord is my witness .
So on my libra scale I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness .
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch well just make sure that bitch is beautiful .
Life on the edge . I'm danglin' my feet .
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me .
Haters can't see me . Nose bleed seats .
And today I went shoppin' . and talk is still cheap .
I rock to the beat of my drum set .
I've been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet .
Huhha . But I'm . Ray Charles to the bullshit
now jump up on that dick and do a full split . uh .
I tell her . now go on pop that pussy for me
haters can't see me but them bitches still lookin' for me .
And you could take that to the bank and deposit that .
Put your two cents in . and get a dollar back .
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about I give the rest of the vowels back .
I like my girl thick . not just kinda fine .
Eat her 'til she cry . Call that wine and dine
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses .
They say choose wisely . That's why I was chosen .
Rockin' like asphalt . It's the cash fault .
Looked . in the face of death . and took its mask off .
Now I like my house big and my grass soft .
I like my girl face south and her ass north .
But I'm . Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split . Uh

and live the phrase sky's the limit .
motherfucker .
see you chumps on top .
Back in elementary . I thrived on misery .
Left me alone I grew up amongst a dyin' breed .
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest .
until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past .
you wanna last . Be the first to blast .
remember Kato . No longer with us he's deceased .
Call on the sirens seen him murdered in the streets
Now rest in peace .
Is there heaven for a G? . Remember me .
So many homies in the cemetery shed so many tears .
Now that I'm strugglin' in this business by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green . but seldom seen .
And fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed .
I'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse
God can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure . and all the pain .
Show me some happiness again .
I'm goin' blind . I spend my time in this cell . ain't livin' well .
I know my destiny is Hell . where did I fail? .
My life is in denial . and when I die .
baptized in eternal fire I'll shed so many tears .
Now I'm lost and I'm weary . so many tears .
I'm suicidal so don't stand near me .
My every move is a calculated step .
to bring me closer to embrace an early death
now there's nothin' left .
There was no mercy on the streets .
I couldn't rest . I'm barely standin'
bout to go to pieces screamin' peace .
And though my soul was deleted . I couldn't see it .
I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free .
They planted seeds and they hatched . sparkin' the flame .
inside my brain like a match such a dirty game .
No memories just a misery .
Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin' me in my sleep .
Will I survive til the moan in to see the sun .
Please Lord forgive me for my sins . 'cause here I come .
Lord knows I . tried . been a witness to homicide .
Seen drive bys takin' lives little kids die .
Wonder why as I walk by .
Broken hearted as I glance at the chalk line . gettin' high .
This ain't the life for me . I wanna change
But ain't no future right for me . I'm stuck in the game .
I'm trapped inside a maze .
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy
Disillusioned lately . I've been really wantin' babies .
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady .
Don't trust my lady . 'Cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearin' noises . think she fuckin' all my boys .
can't take no more . I'm fallin' to the floor .
beggin' for the Lord to let me in to Heaven's door .
shed so many tears .

Uh . Baby you're makin' it
harder better faster stronger .
You know how long I've been on you .
Since prince was on appolonia .
Since O J had isotoners .
Don't act like I never told you
Here it is. :A groove slightly transformed.
Just a bit of a break from the norm.
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony
of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be
a little bit out of control. It's cool to dance,
but what about a groove that soothes and moves romance?.
Give me a soft subtle mix.
And if it ain't broke then don't try to fix it.
And think of the summers of the past.
Adjust the bass, and let the Alpine blast.
Pop in my CD, and let me run a rhyme.
And put your car on cruise, and lay back 'cause this is summertime.
school is out and it's sort of a buzz .
a back then I didn't really know what it was .
but now I see what have of this
the way that people respond to summer madness .
the weather is hot and girls are dressin' less
and checkin' out the fellas to tell 'em who's best .
ridin' around in your jeep or your Benzos .
or in your Nissan sittin' on Lorenzos
back in philly we be out in the park .
a place called the plateau is where everybody go
guys out huntin' and girls doing likewise .
honkin' at the honey in front of you with the light eyes .
she turn around to see what you beepin' at .
it's like the summer's a natural aphrodisiac .
and with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme .
to hit you and to get you equipped for the summer time .
it's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet .
hustle to the mall . to get me a short set .
yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair
'cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there .
the temperature's about eightyeight .
hop in the water plug . just for old times sake .
break to ya crib change your clothes once more
'cause you're invited to a barbeque that's startin' at 4 .
sittin' with your friends as y'all remincise
about the days growin' up and the first person you kiss .
and as I think back makes me wonder how
the smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia .
all the kids playin' out front
little boys messin' round with the girls playin' double dutch .
while the DJ's spinning a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion .
then six o'clock rolls around .
you just finished wipin' your car down .
it's time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout
it looks like a car show .
everybody come lookin' real fine .
fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon .
every moment frontin' and maxin' .
chillin' in the car they spent all day wawin' .
leanin' to the side but you can't speed through .
two miles an hour so everybody sees you .
there's an air of love and of happiness
and this is the fresh prince's new definition of summer madness .
Brakes on a bus . Brakes on a car .
Breaks to make you a superstar .
Breaks to win and breaks to lose .
But these here breaks will rock your shoes .
If your woman steps out with another man
That's the breaks . That's the breaks
And she runs off with him to Japan .
That's the breaks . That's the breaks
And the I R S says they wanna chat
That's the breaks . That's the breaks
And you can't explain why you claimed your cat
That's the breaks . That's the breaks .
And ma bell sends you a whoppin' bill
That's the breaks . That's the breaks .
With eighteen phone calls to brazil .
That's the breaks . That's the breaks
And you borrowed money from the mob .
that's the breaks . That's the breaks .
And yesterday you lost your job .
That's the breaks . That's the breaks .
Throw your hands up in the sky .
And wave 'em round from side to side .
If you deserve . a break tonight .
Somebody say . alright
Breaks on a stage . Breaks on a screen .
Breaks to make your wallet lean .
Breaks run cold and breaks run hot .
Some folks got 'em and some have not .
To the girl in brown stop messin' around .
Break it up . Break it up
To the guy in blue whatcha gonna do
Break it up . Break it up
And to the girl in green don't be so mean
Break it up . Break it up
And the guy in red say what I said .
Break it up . Break it up
Break down .
Brakes on a plane . Brakes on a train .
Breaks to make you go insane .
Breaks in love breaks in war .
But we got the breaks to get you on the floor .
Say last week you met the perfect guy
That's the breaks . That's the breaks
And he promised you the stars in the sky .
That's the breaks . That's the breaks
He said his cadilac was gold .
That's the breaks . That's the breaks
But he didn't say it was ten years old
That's the breaks . That's the breaks
He took you out to the red coach grill
That's the breaks . That's the breaks
But he forgot the cash and you paid the bill
That's the breaks . That's the breaks
And he told you the story of his life .
That's the breaks . That's the breaks
But he forgot the part about . his wife
That's the breaks . That's the breaks Huh.
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well . guess beggars can't be choosy
Wanted to receive . attention for my music .
Wanted to be left alone in public Excuse me .
For wantin' my cake and eat it too . and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon . 'cause my . ego inflated
When I blew see but it was confusing .
'Cause all I wanted to do is be . the Bruce Lee . of loose leaf .
Abused ink . used it as a tool when I blew steam .
Hit the lottery ooh wee .
But with what I gave up to get . it was bittersweet
It was like . winnin' a used mink .
Ironic 'cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink .
I'm beginning to lose sleep . one sheep . two sheep .
Going cuckoo and kooky as Kool Keith .
But I'm actually weirder than you think . 'Cause I'm .
Now I ain't much of a poet .
but I know somebody once told me To seize the moment
and don't squander it .
'Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjurin'
sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from .
Yeah ponder it do you want this?
No wonder you're losin' your mind the way it wanders .
yodel ay hee hoo
I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled on to Jeff Vanaderin .
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself . and all this conflict .
'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me
and I can't conquer it .
My OCD's conkin' me in the head . Keep knockin'
nobody's home . I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relaying what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger I'm friends with the .
Call me crazy but I have this vision .
One day that I'd walk amongst you a regular civilian
But . until then drums get killed and
I'm coming straight at . MC's blood get spilled and
I'll . Take you back to the days that . I'd get on a Dre track .
Give every kid who got played that . Pumped up feelin'
and shit to say back . To the kids who played him .
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children .
But if one kid . out of a hundred million .
Who are going through a struggle feels it
and relates that's . great . It's payback Russell Wilson
fallin' way back In the draft .
turn nothin' into somethin' still can
make that Straw into gold chump I will spin .
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack .
maybe I need a straightjacket face facts
I am nuts for real but I'm okay with that .
It's nothin' I'm still friends with the .
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
and started whoopin' her ass worse than before
they first were divorce throwin' her over furniture .
It's the return of the Ah wait no way . you're kidding .
he didn't just say what I think he did . c he? .
And Doctor Dre said . nothing you idiots
Doctor Dre's dead he's locked in my basement .
feminist women love eminem
chigga chigga chigga slim shady I'm sick of him
Look at him walkin' around grabbin' his you know what .
Flippin' the you know who Yeah but he's so cute though!
Yeah I pro'bly got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms .
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
but can't . but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
My bum is on your lips . my bum is on your lips .
And if I'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss .
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel don't they? .
We ain't nothing but mammals . Well some of us cannibals
who cut other people open like cantaloupes .
But if we can hump dead animals and anteloups
then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope .
but if you feel like I feel I got the antidote .
Women wave your pantyhose sing the chorus and it goes .
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records .
well I do . so fuck him and fuck you too! .
You think I give a damn about a Grammy .
Half of you critics can't even stomach me . let alone stand me
But Slim what if you win wouldn't it be weird? .
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can . sit me here next to Britney Spears? .
Shit Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
so I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst .
and hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first .
little bitch put me on blast on MTV .
Yeah he's cute but I think he's married to Kim hee hee! .
I should download her audio on M P Three
and show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD .
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
all you do is annoy me so I have been sent here to destroy you .
And there's a million of us just like me
who cuss like me who just don't give a fuck like me
who dress like me . walk talk and act like me
it just might be the next best thing but not quite me! .
I'm like a head trip to listen to 'cause I'm only givin' you
things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all .
I just get on the mic and spit it
and whether you like to admit it . I just shit it
better than ninety percent of you rappers out can .
Then you wonder how can
kids eat up these albums like valiums
its funny . 'cause at the rate I'm goin' when I'm thirty .
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting .
Pinchin' nurses asses when I'm jackin' off with Jergens
And I'm jerkin' but this whole bag of Viagra isn't workin' .
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin'
He could be workin' at Burger King spittin' on your onion rings .
or in the parkin' lot circling Screamin' I don't give a fuck!
with his windows down and his system up .
So will the real Shady please stand up? .
And put . one of those fingers on each hand up? .
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
and one more time loud as you can how does it go?
I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
of this weed. It gives me the shit needed to be
the most meanest MC on this on this Earth.
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse
to just curse And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works.
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve all this tension.
Dispensin' these sentences. Gettin' this stress
that's been eatin' me recenyly off of this chest.
And I rest again peacefully.
,but at least have the decency in you
to leave me alone when you freaks see me out
in the streets. When I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
to not come and speak to me. I don't know you
,and no I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing.
I'm not Mister N'Sync. I'm not what your friends think.
I'm not Mister Friendly. I can be a prick. If you tempt me
my tank is on empty. :No patience is in me
,and if you offend me I'm liftin' you ten feet in the air.
I don't care who is there and who saw me just jaw you.
Go call you a lawyer. File you a lawsuit.
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe.
I'm tired of all you. I don't mean to be mean
but that's all I can be, It's just me.
Sometimes I just feel like my father
I hate to be bothered . with all of this nonsense
it's constant And Oh it's his lyrical content
the song Guilty Conscience has gotten such rotten responses
And all of this controversy circles me
and it seems like the media immediately . points a finger at me .
So I point one back at 'em but not the index or pinkie
or the ring or the thumb . it's the one you put up .
when you don't give a fuck . when you won't just put up
with the bullshit they pull 'cause they full of shit too .
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
and they blame it on Marilyn . and the heroin
Where were the parents at? . And look where it's at .
Middle America now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see . an upper class city havin' this happenin' .
then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way .
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need
for the fire to burn and it's burnin' and I have returned .
I'm so sick and tired of being admired
that I wish that I would just die or get fired
and dropped from my label let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on My Name is
And pigeon holed into some poppy sensation
to got me reotation at rock'n'roll stations
And I just do not got the patience .
to deal with these cocky caucasians
who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
'cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
so they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions .
What school did I go to what hood I grew up in
The why the who what when the where and the how .
'til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out .
'cause they drivin' me crazy . I can't take it
I'm racin' I'm pacin' I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every . fan that I get
But I can't take a shit
in the bathroom without someone standin' by it .
No I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole I'm glad .
Ready for action nip it in the bud
we never relaxin' OutKast is ever lastin'
not clashin' not at all
But see my nigga went to do a little . actin'
now that's for anyone askin' give me one pass 'em
Drip Drip Drop there goes an eargasm .
Now you comin' out the side of your face
we tappin' right into your memory banks thanks .
so click it or ticket let's see your seat belt fastened
trunk rattlin' like two midgets in the backseat rasslin'
Speakerboxxx vibrate the tag
make it sound like aluminum cans in a bag
but I know y'all wanted that eightoheight
can you feel that B A S S bass
but I know y'all wanted that eightoheight
can you feel that B A S S bass .
The whole room fell silent the girls all paused with glee
Turnin' left turnin' right are they lookin' at me
Well I was lookin' at them there there on the dancefloor
now they got me in the middlin' feelin' like a man whore .
specially the big girl
big gulls need love too no discrimination here squirrel .
so keep your hands off my cheeks
let me study how you ride the beat you big freak .
skinny slim women got the camel toe within them
you can hump them lift them bend them give them
something to remember yell out
timber when you fall through the chop shop .
take a deep breath an exhale
your ex male friend boyfriend's was borin' as hell
but let me listen to the story you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail on the low hoe
This is why im hot. I don't gotta rap.
I can sell a mill sayin' nothing on the track.
I represent New York. I got it on my back.
Niggas say that we lost it so I'mma bring it back.
I love the dirty dirty, 'Cause niggas show me love.
The ladies start to bounce as soon as I hit the club.
But in the midwest they love to take it slow.
So when I hit the I watch 'em get it on the floor.
And if you needed hi fee I take it to the bay.
Frisco to Sactown they do it everyday.
Compton to Hollywood soon as I hit LA.
Im in that low low I do it the Cali way.
And when I hit the shy people say that I'm fly.
They love the way I dress, they like my attire.
They love how I move crowds from side to side.
They ask me how I do it and simply I reply.

and when I say I'm hot my nigger this is what I mean .

they hop in the car I tell them all aboard .
we hit the studio they say they like how I record .
I gave you black train . and I did you wrong .
so every time I see them man they tell me thats their song .
they say I'm the bomb they love the way the charm
hangin' from the neck . then compliments the arm
which compliments the ear . then comes the gear
so when I hit . the room the shorties stop and stare .
niggas start to hate . rearrange their face
but little do they know I keep them things by waist . side
I reply nobody go . tta die .
similar lil' weez coz I got the fire .

I said I got it goin' on baby doll . and I'm on fire .
took her to the hotel . she said . you're the king .
I said be my queen if you know what I mean and let us do the wild thang
shoppin' at the mall . lookin' for some gear to buy .
I saw this girl she cool rocked my world and I had to adjust my fly .
she looked at me and smiled and said you have plans for the night .
I said hopefully if things go well i'll be with you tonight .
so we journeyed to her house . one thing led to another .
a key in the door I cold hit the floor looked up and it was her mother .
I didn't know what to say . I was hanging by a string .
she said hey you two I was once like you and I liked to do the wild thang
posse in effect . hangin' out is always hype .
and when me and the crew leave the shindig I want a girl who's just my type .
saw this luscious little frame I ain't lyin' fellas she was fine .
the sweet young miss go gave me a kiss and I knew that she was mine .
took her to the limousine . still parked outside .
I tipped the chauffeur when it was over and I gave her . my own ride
couldn't get her off my jack she was . like static cling .
but that's what happens when body start slappin' from doin' the wild thang
doin' a little show . at the local discoteque .
this fine young chick was on my jack so I say what the heck .
she want to come on stage and do her little dance .
so I said chill for now and maybe later . you'll get your chance .

we was all alone and she said tone . let me tell you one thing .

I'm bill droppin' Ms.
My baby's drama mama don't like me.
She doin' things like havin' them boys come from her neighborhood
to the studio tryin' to fight me.
She need to get a piece of American pie and take her bite out.
That's my house. I disconnect the cable and turn the lights out.
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a paycheck.
Private school day care shit medical bills I pay that.
I love your mom and everything see I ain't the one who laid down.
She wanna rib you up start a custody war my lawyers stay down.
You never got a chance to hear my side of the story. We was divided.
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday I ain't invited.
Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through.
All you do is defend that lady when I call you.
Hustler word I pull the trigger long;
Grit my teeth spray 'til every nigga's gone.
Got my block sewn; armored dope spots;
Last thing I sweat's a sucker punk cop.
Move like a king when I roll hops.
You try to flex; BANG another nigga drops.
You gotta deal with this cause there's no way out;
Why? Cash money ain't never gonna play out.
I got nothin' to lose, much to gain;
In my brain I got a capitalist migraine
I gotta get paid tonight you're motherfuckin' right.
Think of my grip, check my bitch, keep my game tight.
So many whores on my jock think I'm a movie star.
nineteen I got a fifty thousand dollar car.
What's up?; You say you wanna be down?.
Ease back or motherfucker get beat down;
Out my face fool I'm the illest
Bulletproof I die harder than Bruce Willis
Got my crew in effect I bought 'em new Jags;
So much cash gotta keep it in Hefty bags.
All I think about is keys and Gs.
Imagine that me workin' in Mickey Ds;
That's a joke cause I'm never gonna be broke.
When I die there'll be bullets and gunsmoke
You don't like my liestyle Fuck you.
I'm rollin' with the New Jack crew.
Here I come so you better break North.
As I stride my gold chains glide back and forth.
I care nothin' 'bout you and that's evident
All I love is my dope and Dead Presidents
Sound crazy Well it isn't
The ends justifies the means that's the system
I learned that in school then I dropped out;
Hit the streets, checked the grip, and now I got clout.
I had nothin' and I wanted it;
You had everything and you flaunted it.
Turned the needy into the greedy
With cocaine my success came speedy
Got me twisted jammed into a paradox
every dollar I get another brother drops;
maybe that's the plan and I don't understand
God damn you got me sinkin' in quicksand
But since I don't know and I ain't never learned;
I gotta get paid; I got money to earn.
With my posse out on the ave;
Bump my sounds crack a forty and laugh.
Cool out and watch my new Benz gleam.
Is this a nightmare Or the American dream?.
So think twice if you're comin' down my block.
You wanna journey through hell?; Well shit gets hot.
Pregnant teens; children's screams;
Life is weighed on the scales of a triple beam.
You don't come here much and you better not;
Wrong move BANG ambulance cot.
I gotta get more money than you got;
So what if some motherfucker gets shot?.
That's how the game is played;
another brother slain; The wound is deep
BUT they're givin' us a Band Aid.
My education low but I got long dough.
Say last week you met the perfect guy
That's the breaks That's the breaks
And he promised you the stars in the sky
That's the breaks That's the breaks
He said his cadilac was gold
That's the breaks That's the breaks
But he didn't say it was ten years old
That's the breaks That's the breaks
He took you out to the red coach grill
That's the breaks That's the breaks
But he forgot the cash and you paid the bill
That's the breaks That's the breaks
And he told you the story of his life
That's the breaks That's the breaks
But he forgot the part about his wife
That's the breaks That's the breaks Huh.
